NICOLE said when you fry the tortilla in the hamburger grease it is a total game changer. Without a doubt it was. 2 ounces of hamburger meat fit perfectly on the 6 inch tortilla. I sprinkled a little of the Nicole’s DYI Taco seasoning as well as put some diced onion on top of the meat before placing the tortilla on top. Then I spread the meat out towards the edges. Then we flipped and added the cheese. After the cheese melted we put shredded lettuce and sliced avocado on half and then added sour cream to the cheese side then folded. Thank you again NICOLE it was a definite new way to make a taco burger we will keep this one around even well past the summer thanks.</p>

The sauce slathered on the inside of the tortilla was so delicious. I also added some cut up tomatoes. I used a cast iron griddle to cook the burgers. Make sure to cook the burger at medium high heat. Watch the tortilla or you could easily burn the tortilla.  I used a spatula to lift up the burger all the way around so the burger wouldn’t stick when I flipped the burger. It was tricky to flip, but I managed by using a spatula and tongs. Next time, I will divide the pound of hamburger into 6 portions and add 2 slices of cheese. Making 6 burgers would fit 6 inch flour tortillas better and it would give more room for the garnishes. I also would love to use a taco holder to make it easier to fold the taco.</p>"

The first ones I made had grease dripping from the bottom as we ate them.  I will try a better-quality burger next time.

But I used 97/3 hamburger thinking I don't wanna eat all the fat ...well.... I think that the far is what makes it not dry. The top of my tortillas got very crunchy but super super dry. Everything was dry sadly. So use higher fat meat!!<br />Because they didn't have the liquid they got burned on the bottom as well. I think the cheese burned out too. 🫤</p><p>I think I'll attempt them again with the higher fat meat and see how they go. I'll keep ya posted</p>

Here is what I did:  Pre-browned lean ground beef, then cooked two cloves garlic, half cup diced red onion, 3 T chopped poblano pepper for a minute in olive oil.  Mixed back in the ground beef and added taco seasoning made from Allrecipes top taco seasoning recipe (so did not follow spices on the original recipe here).  Did not add the canned green peppers.  Tested on both small corn and flour tortillas (Xtreme wellness) that had been microwaved with wet paper towl for 30 seconds.  Put beef mixture on taco with Sargento shredded taco cheese.  Added refried beans to some of them on one side. Cooked in 425 oven for 8 minutes, flipped, 5 minutes more. Did not use oil, used cooking spray on bottom of tray (wax paper) only.  Was exceptional! Will tweak next time - only use flour tortillas (the corn ones were overcooked or cracked), and may try light amount of olive oil instead of cooking spray. Dipped in sour cream and non fat greek yogurt with cilantro and sliced green peppers.&amp;[Great flavors,A keeper!]</p>"

I did alter the cooking procedure based on other reviews and I think it made it much better. The flavours of the coconut milk, ginger and peanut butter were more distinct and deep which made the total flavour more authentic. 
Cooked chicken thighs (bone in) in the crock pot alone for first 5 hours on low. 
I prepared the thighs first by removing the skin the placing it back over thighs for the cooking plus 1/4 cup of water. After 5 hours, I removed thighs and picked off cooked chicken discarding the skin, bones and all juice (grease) in the pot.  I added the sauce which I prepared separately earlier to the CP, re-added  shredded chicken and continued cooking on low for another 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Served over brown rice. 
I really liked it being my first journey into Thai food.  The change in cooking procedures certainly solved many of the issues previous reviewers had with this dish.</p>"

The chicken came out beautifully tender.  The sauce was a little thin so I took it out and reduced it (I put the chicken to the side as I didn't want to overcook it).  Another thing I noticed was that before and after the reduction, there were some areas where the peanut butter had not melted down all the way.  Although it was still delicious, I wish it had integrated a little bit better in the sauce.

The flavors were great.  Had a lot of depth and despite other reviews, I would say it had strong Thai flavors.  I will be making this again.</p>"

I cooked the chicken for 6 hours on low. when i got home after working I  took the chicken out of the crockpot, poured out any liquid that was left  in the crockpot.  shredded the chicken, put the chicken back in the crockpot . retrieved the sauce mixture from the fridge and pour over the chicken and turn on high for about 20 minutes until hot.. the chicken turns out very tender even by cooking it by itself. you wont end up with a watery bland mess. what you get is a thick creamy sauce that retains all flavor because the sauce wasnt overcooked.  i also have a rice cooker that is programmable, so I can set it in the morning to have the rice cooker turn on at a certain time so I have hot rice ready with the meal.</p>"

We take the meat and add in 1.5 packs of taco seasoning, whole diced onion, corn, salsa, Rotel, and refried beans. Instead of the bottom layer of jiffy we take 1-2 boxes of Velveeta shells and cheese(previously cooked with extra butter or olive oil so it doesn't dry out). We then mix all the ingredients listed above with the Velveeta shells and cheese, (add in the last .5 pack of taco seasoning while stirring and butter if the mix looks dry), and spread evenly in the bottom of a 9x11 glass pan and sometimes we end up using a 6x9 glass pan too for the extra and evenly distribute between the pans and same with the jiffy. Then make 2 boxes of jiffy(just like directions on the back of the box) and spread on top and cook for 45 mins until the cornbread is done. Enjoy!!! Kids love it!</p>"

Seriously though, like some of the ideas in this version of tamale pie and will modify my recipe to incorporate some of these ideas. Love the use of the poblanos and the chipotle chili powder. Not so crazy about the salsa - would rather use the canned diced tomatoes (such as Rotel), beef boullion, and onion in the meat mixture so I can control the seasoning better. I also add flour and water at the final stages of cooking the meat so everything thickens to a pot pie filling consistency.<br />For those complaining about the heat, use ancho chile powder instead of chipotle chili powder (you will probably have to use more) and also add cumin to mellow out the sharp bite of the chili.<br />For the cornbread, I also use creamed corn and less milk, and I add diced fresh jalapenos into the bread mix in addition to the monterey jack..</p>"

I viewed photos others posted and  don't know how some got such high, fluffy toppings.  There was not enough corn batter for the bottom or the top and it came out thin after baking.  Because of this, the bottom crust over cooked and was dark brown and crusty, and I only baked it for 50 minutes.  Will make this again, but next time will try doubling the corn meal mixture.</p>"

It is perfect as is but I also add a can on black beans to the meat as I’m cooking it. I also tone down the spice for the kids.

Didn’t have boxed cornbread, so I mixed up a batch and poured it on the top, a couple handfuls of cheese sprinkled on top before baking for about 25-30 minuets.

I cook my pasta shells first this way there's no waiting to refrigerate it overnight once you make the mixture including the ground hamburger meat and mix it all together just stuff it in the shells.

I did run into a problem piping the cheese into the pasta.  It's hard to do one handed with a plastic bag and the filling is pretty thick, so it can pop a weak bag.  I bought a piping kit which is really pretty cheap to find on Amazon for less than $20.</p>"

Luckily I had extra manicotti shells (I adjusted the recipe for 9 servings, meaning 18 shells.  I used 23 shells and still had enough for a few more!)  Secondly, it wasn't very flavorful.  I realize that had a lot to do with the plain store-bought sauce.  But plain store-bought sauce is what makes this convenient and you don't want to start changing that around, so something else should have been done to add more flavor.  I will probably make this again with the modification of (1) less filling ingredients and (2) adding some fresh garlic and maybe even jarred pesto to the filling to bulk up the flavor.  It was nice to do a make-ahead, though.</p>"

Both my hubs and I thought this was edible, but agreed that we'd pass on ever having it again. Oddly, this reminded me of all the frozen (manicotti) entree's I've tried in the past that I didn't like one bit. All the reviews are right - OMIT THE SUGAR! It gives the pasta a sweet taste that just doesn't belong (as subtle as it was). I BY FAR prefer my Pampered Chef florentine stuffed shells recipe. It takes a little work to prepare, but is OH SOOOO GOOD!!! Since I like idea of stuffing uncooked pasta shells (it makes filling a LOT easier!), I might give this another chance using my PC stuffed shells filling recipe instead. NOTE: A few reviewers suggested using a large Zip-Lock bag to ""pipe"" your filling into each manicotti shell. I agree. Simply snip the corner and use it as a pastry bag. A simple garden salad and garlic bread rounded out our weeknight meal. Maybe this will float your boat, but it left us sorely disappointed. Thanks anyways, Sandir. :-)</p>"

But even after sitting in my fridge overnight and most of the following day, the edges of these were still hard after baking.  I think that you really need to drown the manicotti in the sauce in order to get all of the shell to be soft.  We cut a little of the edge off, and every other part was devoured.  My kids loved these.  One other change I made was to add in some fresh spinach that I sliced very thinly and then added to the cheese mixture.  My kids didn't even know it was there, and it was an easy and delicious way to add some green to their meal.</p>"

I added a bit of water to my sauce before pouring onto the noodles, and did not have any problems with it drying out.

I followed the recipe exactly except threw in some extra cottage cheese that I needed to use up and it turned out fabulous.  I doubled up the ingredients so I could freeze some for later.  
Put them on a cookie sheet to allow them to freeze and then put them into gallon bags so I could pull out what I needed for that specific occasion.  
Great way to get your kids to eat vegis too!

I always hated how manicotti got really watery after baking if I boiled the noodles first.  Not only are the uncooked noodles easier to pipe into, they hold up after baking.  The refrigeration allows the flavors to meld, and gives a finished restaurant quality product.  My husband and I are vegetarian, so we add morningstar crumbles to the sauce before baking and this makes for a hearty dish that please both veggies and non-veggies alike.  The spinach mixture would make an excellent lasagna as well.</p>"

I like it because it can be made ahead of time so the work and the mess is done before your guests show up. It also freezes well but be prepared, as it takes about twice as long to cook when frozen. 

My tweaks include: using 2 jars of sauce, not quite as much spinach, added mushrooms (canned or fresh), and lighten up with skim ricotta, egg substitute and reduced fat mozarella. In a pinch I've used shells rather than manicotti tubes.</p>"

Next time I make, I will use more sauce as 1 jar didn't seem to be enough, reduce the ricotta, add more motzarella &amp; bake for a little less time.  That may make it more cheesy &amp; more saucy.  Overall I really did like this dish &amp; would make again!  My husband is not a big Italian fan.  He said this seeemed like a dish you would get in a restaraunt, I see this as a compliment!</p>"

Here are my ""tweaks"" to offer: 1) I add crumbled and browned italian sausage (turkey or pork) to the mix to make it more substantial since my guy likes to have meat on the table! 2) I definitely think it needs the extra sauce. I use 1.5 jars. Using the jumbo pasta shells makes this the simplest recipe ever. I usually make this on Sunday night when making Sunday dinner so that Monday night's dinner is a no-brainer!!

It takes just a few minutes to prepare and stuff the shells and best of all it doesn't create a huge mess in the kitchen if you do it before bed like I did. Like another person said, I would add more sauce as it cooks because the noodles on the outside got a bit tough. It called for 12 shells and I used the entire package as there were only a few more than 12 and I had plenty of the cheese mixture. For those not so fond of spinach, like my husband, he recommends using half the spinach or better yet none. He thought it would have been good with just the cheese mixture and then adding ground beef to the sauce. So next time I make this, I might split the cheese mixture in half and use spinach only on my half. I could make 2 dishes with half spinach and half plain cheese and try freezing one. This is also a great dish if you need to deliver a meal to someone in snap.</p>"

And...it’s awesome.  Flavors of the indicated ingredients is honestly all you need..resist the urge to add additional seasoning, thickening, or alter ratios on your first try with this recipe (‘cept maybe upping the ham qty).

The only ingredient substitution I made was to use regular Cheddar cheese rather than sharp, as I am not a fan of sharp cheddar, and the Monterey Jack does have a distinctive flavour of its own.  In future, I may also experiment with using fresh spinach - I like the idea of finding whole spinach leaves in the casserole.</p>"

I added 1/2 pound of bacon and I sauteed fresh mushroom and onions . I actually use hash-browns mixed with the croutons for the base. I bake this without any foil or anything on top because it needs to dry out a bit, for about an hour, then take it out and put some more cheese on it...then bake it for about 10 more minutes with the cheese. When I want to make it spicy, I saute Serrano peppers with the onions and mushrooms. All this takes more time, but makes it so tasty.

No canned soup.  And I used diced French bread.  My husband loved it so much that he had it for dinner tonight.</p>"

I think there were two places where it lacked, one of them was no fault of the recipe. I purchased Bob Evans “Hot” sausage. The sausage was lacking in the flavor department. I bet sausage from a local butcher would have helped greatly. The other, instead of croutons, potatoes might have given it a less mushy and more rewarding texture. Again, overall, very good. I will make it again with slight modifications.</p>"

I always make it with twice the amount of sausage the recipe calls for because that's our personal preference. I love that you can use the sausage to season the whole dish, so it doesn't require having lots of spices on hand and measuring them out. The biggest challenge is finding the orecchiette, which I prefer to use because the shape really holds the sauce nicely. My husband is 100% Italian, and both his mother and grandmother helped me learn to cook Italian food. It was a revelation to me that you can simply cook the pasta in broth in the pan. It saves both dishes and time to use this technique! It's so true that the liquid comes out completely silky. I use baby arugula because my husband (shockingly!) doesn't really like the taste of arugula. I like using a mix of spinach and arugula for nutritional purposes. Whatever you use, you'll love this recipe! It's in my regular rotation, and I'm sure it will be in yours, too, once you try it.

I used baby arugula instead of regular because that was all the store had. This is really delicious. I was wondering while I was eating if adding a bit of white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the pasta and chicken stock  would elevate this dish to another level. To be honest it is delicious as is but I may try next time. I also followed his advice on using unsalted chicken stock, it was perfect, I think if I used low sodium or regular it would’ve been too salty. 
Great recipe! Thank You</p>"

I don't like being one of those people who rate it 5 stars then list the changes, but in his video for this recipe, he even mentions that there are lots of ways you can make variations and that you should do what works best for you (in his words - ""you are the Mork of your fork""). So, here's the variation that works best for me: I  add garlic when I saute the onions, use bulk mild sausage, use whatever pasta I have on hand, add some mushrooms when I add the pasta, use spinach instead of  arugula, and mix in about a small handful of mozzarella cheese before serving (just enough so that when I stir it, it gets all stringy but not enough to overpower). I love having this dish, and have made it for friends and family, and they always like it too! It makes quite a bit, but it does freeze and reheat pretty well.</p>"

Since I read that there was lots of spilling, I seared the thighs 5 minutes per side and covered with a lid while searing. Then, I popped the thighs in the oven to finish cooking them. The result was a very crispy chicken. I had to make my own dry ranch dressing using the recipe from this site which is pretty easy and with a lot less salt than the regular ranch powder. The result was good. My only recommendation if you go this route, is to rectify salt to your taste. Will make this again and pair it with any type of fresh salad. YUM!!!</p>"

Patted the chicken dry, did the light flour dredge, and put it in the pan on medium. Smoked more than I was ready for when I turned to side 2, but then I was immediately distracted by the war zone oil popping. Tried to sneak a glass lid on between the shots, and it promptly slid off and shattered on the floor. Determined to continue, I put my arm up to guard my face and turned the heat down to low. Continued cooking to 5 minutes on each side and it did look perfectly browned. I turned the heat up to medium low and cautiously approached the pan. I dumped the capers in and they promptly returned fire like the reinforcements troops of the chicken. Not to be outdone by a teaspoon of some kind of weird mini black balls, I dove gallantly back in, turned the heat back to low, and smashed away with a fork. Feeling more confident now, I turned the heat back up to medium and approached with my carefully pre measured lemon juice, wine, butter, and water. I poured them in with gusto and started stirring to thicken. I kept stirring. Time passed. Poured myself a glass of the picatta wine. Finally gave up and used the thin sauce over the beautiful chicken. All in all, the chicken was perfectly browned, the sauce had a nice flavor, and both I and the chicken enjoyed a good bottle of white. Thanks for the experience, although my housekeeper is likely going to charge me extra for cleaning that stove. ;)&amp;[OK with tweaks]</p>"

I liked it a lot, but not my all time favorite dish.  The lemon flavor really stood out, but I didn't taste the wine so much.  One other thing to note is that it took me way longer to make than the cooking time suggested. Being my first time making it, I admit that I was a bit slower.  I paired it with green beans and angel hair pasta with herbs in a butter sauce.</p>"

I sauted fresh mushrooms, onions, and garlic, I transferred the sauted veggies to a bowl and added butter to the drippings in the pot. I then browned the chicken in batches of 2 (I only had 4 boneless theighs) each time I transferred the chicken to a bowl and added water to the drippings in the pot then I transferred the water to a bowl and repeated the process (this was how I made my own chicken broth.) Once done, I then put the sauted onions, mushrooms, and garlic back into the pot and added the rice with my homemade chicken broth seasoned with Knorr chicken bullion for flavor and added the juices from the meat that was sitting in the bowl. I let the rice cook for about 3 minutes and added some frozen broccoli. I don't have a Dutch oven so, I put the rice mixture with the vegetables in a 9x13 non stick pan and put the theighs on top of the rice mixture and poured the remaining broth on top and baked it for 45 minutes covered with foil and baked it another 5 uncovered. The rice cooked perfectly and the chicken was so juicy, tender, and falling apart. I will definitely make this again.</p>"

The chicken was tender, the rice was perfectly cooked, it all just needed some extra flavour.

I also think it needs more flavourful herbs than parsley - I think I'll try some fresh basil or thyme next time, along with more lemon juice than recommended and the zest of the lemon added after the vegetables finish frying.</p><p>Also, I found the cooking time more than a little bit out.

It’s easy, yummy, and comforting. A few things I’ve learned from experience:</p><p>- I use a lot of onion - 2 whole onions.<br />- You’ll need to experiment to find the right amount of salt. Chicken broth can vary a lot in terms of sodium. I’ve started using bone broth for a deeper flavor and extra nutrition.<br />- if you use a nonstick pan, you can probably skip the oil and butter. The chicken will render enough fat on its own.<br />- These days, chicken thighs are often closer to 6 oz. than 4 oz., so you may find yourself using fewer pieces of chicken or more meat.&amp;[A keeper!]</p>"

It's a very good recipe as is, but as my dad said, something's missing. So I made it again, and this time, added 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper along with the onions, and 1 small can mushrooms (drained) after browning the rice. I also used salted butter. To finish, I took the lid off the last 5 minutes of cooking so the chicken skin would crisp back up. And Dad said, now it's a 5!<br />Next time I'm going to use the Uncle Ben's white and wild rice mix and see what the seasoning packet in that adds to it.&amp;[Needs more flavor]</p>"

IT WAS FANTASTIC. Will make it again! Tip: regular long grain will render a ""creamier"" sticky rice. Basmati will render a drier but still fluffy rice. Beware that it may dry at the top and become crispy like the chicken. To prevent over browning of the top layer cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes then broil uncovered for 5 minutes. This will crisp the chicken.</p>"

I doubled the recipe and used Farro instead of rice. I baked it about an hour so that all of the liquid was absorbed by the grains. I also added about 1.5 tablespoons of well chopped up fresh rosemary, just because I have plenty of it and it goes well with anything.

After frying this large batch of chicken there was more oil in the the pan than I’m comfortable with, so I spooned all of the fat out of the skillet except for about a tablespoon before I added the butter to the skillet. I scraped up all the bits then rather than waiting until the broth was added, then sautéed the onions with the skillet bits.

I loved cooking this in my large cast iron skillet because, well, like rosemary, the cast iron skillet is good for cooking anything.

I wish I knew how change the photo size so that I could upload it because the dish is absolutely beautiful and the chicken is stunningly golden. Sorry I can’t

I only used 4 thighs and I used sweet onion because it’s what I had, I also omitted the lemon because I didn’t have any. I wound up browning the chicken for longer to get a nice, crispy skin on the outside. I added some garlic in with the onion for the last minute or so. I really like the step of coating the dry rice in the butter and drippings, it did a lot for the flavor and texture of the rice in the finished dish. I was concerned that putting the chicken thighs over the rice/broth would make them soggy but that did not happen. I checked it shortly before it was supposed to be done and added a bit more broth. The chicken came out juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside and the rice was cooked perfectly. I served a simple salad on the side. My husband and 7 year old daughter cleaned their plates and went back for seconds. I made it all in a non-enameled cast iron Dutch oven. I’m making it again tonight!</p>"

We used roasted red pepper hummus and put chicken, bell pepper, artichoke hearts, black olives, mozzarella and feta cheese.  I sprinkled red chili pepper flakes all over the top of the pizza.

We prebaked the pizza for 7 minutes at 350 degrees.  Then we topped the pizza and baked it for about 10 more minutes at the same temperature.</p>"

The hummus as the sauce gives this pizza an interesting flavor, but it's subtle, so if you don't like hummus don't count this one out if you're looking for something healthy to eat. Try it! This would be a good one to experiment with and use different toppings for variety. Thank you for this recipe!</p>"

I used homemade hummus and instead of broccoli I topped the pizza with caramelized onions, red peppers, and mushrooms.  It was surprisingly filling, and I could only finish a slice and a half.  The only thing I found, is that the hummus towards the crust that I didn't put any cheese on, seemed to be kind of crunchy and dry.  Definitely make sure you put the cheese all over the hummus or brush it with some olive oil.  It was still tasty, but had a weird texture.</p>"

When chopping the bell peppers, I removed the inner membrane (the white/pale bits around the seeds) as much as possible.  I used garlic hummus and premade pizza dough.  I cooked all this at 450 until the dough was golden, maybe 15 mins?

If I had better knife skills, this would be faster than ordering pizza!</p>"

Everyone in my house was pretty skeptical about using hummus for the sauce but it really came out amazing!  I think it might be my new favorite pizza.  I didn't use broccoli but sauteed other veggies instead.  I don't think it really matters what veggies you put on - it is the hummus that makes this unique.</p>

With no Marsala or cooking sherry, I used a mixture of dry sherry, Bristol Cream, and Courvoisier.  I missed the tip in the video to keep the lid tilted while simmering and ended up with a very liquid sauce. So I made a slurry with some of the flour I had kept to thicken the sauce. This was absolutely delicious.  this will be added to my list of dishes for entertaining. I think it could easily be made in advance and kept warm in the oven, or even refrigerated and reheated when it's time to sit down.</p>"

First, be sure to use real Marsala, not the cheap domestic stuff which is not really Marsala in taste and you must use 3-4X more than spending $10 on the real thing. If you must add Sherry (and I don't know why you would), same thing applies. Use a real Fino or Manzanilla, not a Cream Sherry. Oh, and all ""cooking sherry"" has salt added so you can't drink it and bear in mind when you are adding the salt as suggested.</p>"

I had never thought of using a little heavy cream in the sauce, but will try that next time. A little garlic and a few capers finish the dish for me.

Knowing my family, I cut the cayenne in half. Because coconut aminos is less salty than soy sauce, this recipe was not very salty. I actually added a bit of salt. The spice was still hot for most people, but I liked it. My husband commented, ""How can this not burn my tongue but burn the heck out of my throat?""</p><p>I've never had bulgogi, so don't know how this compares to that, but the way I made it tasted just like sesame chicken Chinese food, which I love. The family members that like Chinese food also enjoyed this meal, even with the spice. Reducing and let sit overnight really boosted the flavor.</p><p>My one huge complaint is the amount of oil, which hurt my stomach and must skyrocket the calories in this meal. I'm going to hunt for a way to maintain the flavor but cut the oil. I'd like to try this recipe again. Three stars because of the mass of oil, otherwise it'd be four stars.

I cut down the minced garlic to a scant tablespoon per a lot of comments. I may have cut the strips too wide. It took about 12 minutes for the sauce to concentrate. Perhaps I did cook too long but it was unbelievably salty. Not sure if I will attempt it again with low sodium soy sauce or just bag it. The chicken ended up somewhat dry on top of the saltiness so, all in all, I was under-impressed with the recipe. I was somewhat flummoxed that so many had rated it with five stars.</p>"

I doubled the olive oil and butter, but left chili oil at 1 tsp. (I will double next time). I diced 5 scallions ( plus green tips) and 1/2 large red bell pepper (these added extra flavor and color to an otherwise colorless dish &amp;  boosted presentation.  I also served with a side of steamed broccoli and french baguette - lightly toasted and brushed with garlic butter.)   I also omitted chicken broth, but  increased wine to 2 C.  Added basil, the bacon crumbles,  and lemon juice, salt, pepper, &amp; then thickened the sauce with a fluid paste of flour and water - Superb!  Everyone raved.  So simple, and easy.

Recipe calls for sugar snap pea pods while the picture looks like either canned or frozen peas.  The picture shows tomatoes but the recipe didn't call for them.  I made it with sugar snap pea pods, cherub tomatoes and instead of chili oil I used orange sauce.  It was good and I'll make it again.  It is interesting that if you have leftovers they are really good the next day as a cold salad.  Also, it's one of those recipes where the amounts of the ingredients is really subject to your particular tastes.  Put in more shrimp, less shrimp, no butter, more lemon juice.  It's just a good map to follow and where you end up is your decision.</p>"

I followed the recipe loosely, skipping the chili oil as I'm not fond of things hot.

Also I would recommend adding the shrimp right after the wine as the shrimp is a delicate meat. Also added twice the garlic, twice the butter, very roughly chopped basil for a more distinct flavor and  use thin noodles (thin spaghetti, vermicelli).

23476292,6572895,aswann,4,5,0,1302634704037,https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/5572734,"<p>A great base recipe.  I assimilated some suggestions of other reviewers and made some changes of my own: 1. I used about 2/3 of the pasta, at most.  2. I used siracha (to my taste) rather than chili oil.  3. I used pre-cooked shrimp (mixed in during the last step) and gave the snap peas a good saute.  4. I doubled the garlic to four cloves.  5. I skipped the butter, but used olive oil as needed.  6. Instead of the basil, I tossed the pasta with about three spoonfuls of pesto sauce (and a bit of black pepper).  7. Rather than lemon, I squeezed in the juice of almost half a lime.

The result was fantastic!  No shortage of flavor, but still a simple, harmonious combination that really made each ingredient shine.  My husband said it was among the best pasta dishes I've ever made, and it's definitely going on the permanent rotation :)

Note: I also mixed a teaspoon of cornstarch into the sauce, which worked out great but might not be necessary.  The wine I used was some slightly vinegary leftover Sauvignon blanc.</p>"

Also, I only used 2/3 pound of the pea pods, and next time I would still use less. Though, I am a healthy eater and love greens in my pasta dishes, next time I'm going to switch the sugar snap pea pods with spinach.

Go with this version.  Makes very nice soft chicken tacos.  I would recommend covering after it cools - do not drain ! - and put it in the fridge over night.  The flavors become much more developed that way since it basically marinates until the next day. 

When we made leftovers, I also added a squeeze of lime juice and a little cilantro. So good. 

The only changes I made were to leave out the chiles ( because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy) and using chicken tenders instead of breasts since that's what I had. Only cooked for 4 hours and they were perfectly done.  

By the way, this chicken is so juicy.  There's no way it can dry out or burn in the slow cooker. Give it a try</p>"

I do recommend cooking for half an hour less than the time stated in the recipe -- my mom always told me to do that with slow cooker recipes and the chicken would have been a little overcooked if I hadn't.

My son went  back for seconds which he never does with salmon. And we eat a LOT of salmon since we live in a salmon fishing village in Alaska. I followed some of the other reviews and squeezed fresh lemon over the top just before putting in the oven (the picture shows lemon, but the recipe doesn't call for it??). I also sprinkled garlic salt. My husband even re-named it, ""Salmon Fresco""! He even said the dish looked like something served in a nice restaurant.  The tomatoes and green onion don't add flavor to the salmon (like a marinade would because it seeps into the fillet) but taste great on their own, enhancing each bite with fresh-tasting flavor.

All in all, well received and the chicken breasts were very moist/juicy (even though someone reheated fast food, instead of eating the dinner I prepared [AHEM!] ... they may get to sleep outside, tonight!).  I may tone down the dressing for my people (they aren't big sauce fans).

In hindsight, probably not too surprising since I do not use commercially prepared dressings for my salads. All that being said, the crushed croutons on top were crispy and delicious and gave the chicken breasts a very good flavor. Just not enough to overcome the strong processed flavor from the dressing. I think with a few tweaks, I can make this recipe my own and one that will be enjoyed by both of us.</p>"

Simply the ingredient list and cooking instructions tell me it is a 5-star.<br />I also wanted to make a note to reply to judygoldin.  There are very very few recipes for baking chicken that require turning of the chicken. That is the point of baking chicken, fish, beef, pork, etc combined with the flavorful ingredients: you simply combine your recipe and pop it in the oven, no extra work required.  Occasionally, if you want grilled/caramelizad on all surfaces, a recipe may call for a high-heat sear on all surfaces followed by completely cooking the meat in with oven (without turning). For example, this is the best way to prepare filet mignon.</p><p>In reply to the person “Allrecipes member” who also posted 06/27/23: I very rarely may post a review before I have actually made that particular recipe. I have been cooking and “making” my own recipes for more than 60 years and I am a good judge of quality simply by looking at ingredients and instructions.<br />I personally have also posted derogatory comments towards those who change the recipe, changing one or almost all ingredients then posting a review on their changes.<br />Finally, I  have since made this recipe Written As Is and, as I stated previously, it is a 5-star.</p>"

You will get all of the texture with none of the stray seeds. All that remains will be dry solids.  Or use a squeezo type implement which will also get every drop. Squeezo is quicker, but more clean-up.  The recipe (without doubling) made 3 different dishes  Roasted everything over a wood fire. Added 1 Pasilla chile. Cooked everything down slowly in 4c stock, as I had cooked the chicken first. I used 2 pans for the liquid. First pan was just what drained out. 2nd, the results of pressing it thru the sieve.  I made tamales using the birria 'soup' from pan 1 instead of water or stock in the masa. Lastly, I made street tacos using some of the meat plus cilantro, onion and lime for the filling. All in all, 2 hearty bowls of soup, 10 taquitos, and a bakers dozen tamales. The yield made it worth the time involved. I still have about a cup n a half of the soup, and a thighs-worth of meat. Will add some root veg &amp; a zucchini (and maybe a little more stock) for a quick dinner for 2 tomorrow.  Hubs was pleased.

I recommend serving with Avocado spears as well!<br />3. I didn't have dried guajillo peppers, so I used 6 California/Aneheim peppers, and added a fresh poblano and Jalepeno pepper.

The amount of dressing was WAY too much for the amount of salad, so I'll have to find a way to use up the leftovers.  Also, the level of sugar was too high.  I halved the amount of sugar, and  it was still VERY sweet.  It could have used even less.  I prefer a 2:1 ratio of oil to vinegar in my dressings, so I cut the oil to 2/3 cup, and that was just right for me.  I plan to make this recipe often (with my modifications).</p>"

Fruit on hand was strawberries and blueberries. A very refreshing and light meal!</p>

My son has called me from college several times asking for the recipe.  You have so much flexibility when making this salad.  Whatever fruit you happen to have on hand works great.

I did what several reviewers recommended:  reduced the amount of sugar in the dressing and marinated the chicken before cooking.  I didn't want to fire up the grill for just 2 pieces of chicken, so cooked it in a pan on the stove. Oh yes, and I just used the romaine and iceberg lettuce I had on hand.  Wonderful wonderful!!
For the marinade, I used a little each of the following: orange juice, pineapple juice, powdered garlic, Montreal Steak Seasoning and olive oil - just things I had on hand. The salad dressing is what makes this salad, no matter what other ingredients you add.</p>"

Even the leftovers were amazingly tasty.  I can not wait to make this time and time again!!

10-25-15.    Made again for dinner last night, with some minor changes. Produce market was out of strawberries, so I had to use fresh clementines.   Also, I ran out of pecans, but had plenty of sliced almonds. I toasted them up and in they went. Lastly, to my surprise i was out of red wine vinegar.  I had plenty of white, so white it was!

My son, who hates onion loved it, even after I told him what was in it, and gave it a rave review FoodTV-style. I did use about 3/4c oil and a little less than 1/2c sugar. The slight spice from the pepper and the onion flavor was perfect. You could use onion powder or onion salt, as some strawberry spinach recipes do, but I think the fresh onion just makes it much better. I used a spring salad and some spinach because it's just what I had around. Everything else I always have around, so this is a fabulous quick spring or summer dinner when I can't think of anything else. We used strawberries and mandarin oranges, but I think this would definitely work with pears, apples, raisins, dried cranberries...just about anything you can imagine on a salad. I was specifically requested by my pickiest eater to have this again and often. Great recipe. Thank you!</p>"

The salad dressing is very versatile...we've used various fruits, different types of meat and lettuce.  We grilled pork chops and used apples, walnuts and the cherry craisins - yummy!  The first time I made this recipe, I mistakenly added ground nutmeg to the dressing.  It was awesome.  So I've never tried it without.  I also substitute dried minced onion in place of fresh, splenda in place of the sugar, and grapeseed oil is really good in place of the traditional vegetable oil.  I would definitely marinade your meat, if you have the time.  For the chicken, try the McCormick's Grill Mates - Baja Citrus - it's very tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe...we've made it several times already and it will be used just as much in the future!</p>"

I did start by flouring the chicken but I'm not sure this is a necessary step.   The instructions say to cover the chicken in the skillet for 15 minutes and that just seemed to be steaming it and gave it a mushy texture that I didn't care for.   I ended up removing the lid halfway thru and would probably try it uncovered next time.  (Either the flour or the lid needs to go because I would prefer the chicken to brown a little!!!)  I looked for fresh tarragon (which I love with chicken) but the only store that had it was $3.99 for this tiny little bunch and I thought that was a pretty ridiculous price when I only needed 2 teas. so I used the dried instead.  It was fine...but I could see the fresh tarragon being even better because it has such a unique flavor profile.  I tried to make extra sauce by using 1 cup of heavy cream rather than the called for 1/2 cup and I used 1.5 TBS Dijon and about 3/4 teas. dried tarragon.  I also added a large diced shallot, minced garlic and some white wine before adding the cream and that was a fantastic suggestion that I will continue.   I could picture the mushrooms being a nice addition but my son doesn't like them so I opted to pass on that idea and save the drama.</p><p>Overall, this turned out really, really well and was super tasty.  It will definitely slip into a somewhat regular rotation for us.  I normally sub half &amp; half for heavy cream as my DH needs a low fat diet so next time I'll try that as an additional change just to compare.  If it's barely noticeable then that will be my go-to for the future.   This gets two thumbs up from us!!</p>"

After removing the chicken from the pan, I sautéed shallots and garlic in a little butter, then added tarragon and stirred for a couple of minutes until fragrant. I sprinkled a small amount of flour to form a light rue, stirring for a minute or two. I deglazed with white wine and seasoned with salt and pepper before  adding cream and Dijon. Allowed the sauce to thicken a little before returning chicken to pan until heated through. Great served with mixed grain pilaf and steamed asparagus. Lovely dinner - thanks for the recipe.</p>"

One thing I will recommend is plating it with fresh arugula under the chicken, then adding the sauce. The peppery taste goes well with the other flavors. Finally, I always double the sauce because its so good. I have used the leftover sauce as a pasta sauce and its wonderful as well. That is, if there are any leftovers!</p>"

Great base recipe due to it's versitality, that is why I gave this recipe a 5 star rating. I always tweak recipes to suit my family's palate. I seasoned flour with salt and pepper, garlic powder, cayenne and summer savory. Lightly floured the chicken and cooked in the olive oil/butter combo. I took the chicken out and sauteed garlic and onions before adding the heavy cream. It was a little thick to my liking so I added chicken broth to thin it out. Once I added the tarragon and dijon, I let it simmer to meld the flavors before returning the chicken and spooning the  sauce on top. My picky 10 yr old son ate seconds!</p>"

I have been using this recipe for years.  It's great as written but I've made two minor changes.  One because I'm lazy and the second because I prefer the sauce a little thicker.  First, I bake the chicken separately with a little oil, salt and pepper and covered with foil to keep it moist.  Then I put the sauce together and add the chicken when it's cooked. To make the sauce, I use 1 T. butter, 1 T. flour, 1. T. Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup half and half or heavy cream. Once it's together, I add the fresh tarragon (a sprig or two that I remove when serving). I add the chicken and  simmer it all on very low heat while I cook egg noodles (about 10 minutes).   My husband loves it. It's a winner.</p>"

I didn't have tarragon but used a bit of herbs d'province.  I also followed reviewers suggestions to put dijon directly on the chicken and let them sit and deglazed my pan with about 1/4 cup white wine.  This tasted like I had gone to a fine French restaurant and I've dined in Paris at fine French restaurants before.  It was without a doubt, the best recipe I've used from this site.

This recipe has gone through various transitions thru the years, but still never fails to impress me.  Though it tastes wonderful as written it is also the perfect recipe for customizing to your family's individual likes and dislikes.  I lightly saute the chicken with a dusting of flour, salt, white pepper, garlic and onion powder  and remove when done, then in the same pan, saute 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1/2 cup minced shallots, and package of Bella baby mushrooms to give the sauce a more earthy taste.  When the mushrooms have cooked down, add your tarragon, 1.5 tbsp mustard and the cream back to the pot and let simmer for 5 minutes to thicken; make sure to scrap up the fabulous drippings in the pan, as they really help flavor it.  Add the chicken back to the pan, coat with sauce and serve.  Wonderful Deltaqueen50, simply wonderful!  Thank you for sharing.</p>"

My 3 year old son also ate a huge portion and gave it 2 thumbs up. I made some modifications..I made my own Italian style seasoning because I only had plain bread crumbs. I also used unmelted butter on the top of the chicken (still using melted butter in the pan). Placing a 1/4 -1/2 tsp of solid butter on top of each chicken piece.I baked it for roughly 40 minutes at 350. Using a meat thermometer to ensure it was cooked to 165 degrees. Great recipe! 5 stars.</p>"

Many years ago I switched to a mixture of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and lemon juice. In my opinion, this mixture produces tastier results. When adding the lemon juice to the other 2 ingredients,  I do it gradually until the mixture is about twice as thick as the milk and egg mixture</p>"

To get an even application of butter on the top of the tenders, I put them into the buttered dish, then flipped them over before baking, so both sides of the tenders had butter on them. Despite this effort, the coating still didn't really brown. The coating was tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy, though, so I still consider it a success and will make them again.</p>"

I used horseradish cheddar cheese (which maybe gave it a bit more kick, but really wasn't spicy), and I subbed in panko for the cereal.  I think I might cut down on the bread crumbs next time, as they seemed to overwhelm the cheese and panko.  I cut back on the salt while baking (for my husband) and added back in at the table.

First of all, I slow cooked the chili with the exception of browning the chicken with the onion and garlic. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, added corn and steamed asparagus for veggies, thickened the chicken broth with cornstarch (wayyyy too soupy for us), and replaced the sour cream by plain Greek yogurt for added protein. I couldn’t find canned green chillies at the grocery store, so I used a large jalapeño pepper and one yellow pepper that I had in hand. Turned out to be fantastic that way. Great starter recipe, but needed a few tweaks to suit our preferences and lifestyle.&amp;[OK with tweaks]</p>"

Double or triple pretty much everything and it's better. I pre season the chicken with paprika, cumin, garlic power and onion powder and salt and pepper then pour olive oil and a tiny bit of broth into a slow cooker and put it on high for about 2.5 hours.  I shred it finely before adding. Before adding the chicken I cook the onions WITH half a can of green chiles, then add in the garlic. Once that's nice and fragrant I add the chicken and the rest of the spices. Then I add the beans and broth. I usually also add in nearly an entire cup of pepper jack cheese at the end. It's super good. I would give the recipe 5 stars but as is it's a little bland so Definitely season with your heart ❤️&amp;[Needs more flavor]</p>"

I didn't have exactly everything on hand so I used what I did have.  I cooked a chicken thigh &amp; leg in the broth then shredded the meat off bone to add to the broth.  The soup need more meat so I made small turkey meatballs and added them (raw) to the soup.  I didn't have orzo in the pantry so I used 1/4 cup Ditalini #63 .  That was plenty.  Add more it you like a lot of pasta in your soup.  Just remember that the pasta will absorb a lot of broth.  You could cook the pasta on the side and add to the broth just before warming up a bowl.   I also added the juice of one lemon a little at a time tasting until I like the flavor.  Delicious!</p>

If you've got a reason to make it, it'll obviously be better with homemade chicken stock.

The first time I made this we followed the directions as I could (we couldn't find quick cooking wild rice mix with seasoning, so we used a name brand that takes 25 min to cook) and it was delicious. We cooked the rice per package directions, omitting the seasoning and set it aside, and then followed the recipe. After the first try, to accommodate those with health issues, I used 2% milk, started with 1/2 cup of flour, added more as needed to attain the desired thickness. As well, I added 1 cup of cooked/boiled carrots, and 1/2 cup of sautéed onions. The additions worked out well and added even more color. Turkey has been substituted for chicken, and if I have some on hand, I substitute turkey broth for chicken broth. A tasty way to use leftover turkey.  :)  A big ""thank you"" to Stephanie Fenley Garcia for posting the recipe.&amp;[Family favorite]</p>"

I used a half of rotisserie chicken I had on hand and that made it even easier.  I only had a box of Rice Pilaf so that's what I used and it was still great.  I'm sure it's better with wild grain rice and will give that a try next time but I used what I had when I had a wild hair to make soup today.  I thinned it a little bit with milk and appreciated that suggestion from the submitter.  Perfect recipe and it needs nothing else.</p>

I probably won't have cream on hand next time and so will use cream of chicken soup, and increase the flour and butter. My two rotisserie chicken breasts From Market Basket came to 14 oz.

I just want to say that as a frequent maker of roux, there is a shortcut. Melt the butter, whisk in the flour &amp; cook for just a minute or two to cook out the raw flour taste. Now is the time to toss in any veg that you want to cook down(onion, celery, ...). Trust me it'll be okay despite looking like it has curdled. It'll all smooth out when you whisk in the liquids. After the veg is translucent, add the liquids. There is absolutely no benefit to adding the seasoning packet to the butter and a good reason not to, it could burn if you fail to manage the heat well(accidents happen).</p>"

I used chicken breasts with the bone that I put in my crock pot for a few hours with some broth.   The bones make the broth flavorful.

Over the years I’ve changed it up a bit: now I add match stix carrots, some onion and celery to the butter till the onions are clear. Then i do the roux. 
After I have added the roux to the rice/chicken /broth and cooked it for 20-25 min- I remove from heat and add sherry covering the soup to cool. It’s best the following day or even 3-4 days later kept cold in the fridge as the flavors marry. If the soup is too thick when ready to eat add a little broth or milk/cream to thin it a bit. I have used rotisserie chicken or even frozen shredded chicken with equally good results. Oh so Yummy!!</p>"

The reason its bland is cuz we normally eat it with a sauce that u drizzle over it, or dip it in there. We call it donkatsu sauce, idk what actually is in it but I suggest looking up a separate sauce recipe to pair with this dish. When i make it at home, i normally have a pre-made bottle on hand which I purchase at the korean market. Its thick and brown, and has a distinct flavor that goes well with this dish. Hope that helps someone.</p>"

As others have pointed out, use a GOOD beer and not a watery beer. I used a founders IPA 22oz can. I also added a poblano pepper and made my own taco seasoning and went a bit heavier on the amount of taco seasoning. I cooked the onion and pepper in a pot, towards the end I added the seasoning to toast up a bit, de-glazed it with the beer, then added it to the slow cooker and did the recipe as described. With a few tweaks, this recipe is both great and you get a good amount if you have have a large family or like to cook for the week.</p><p>&amp;[OK with tweaks]</p>"

We also love making it for other people as we always get ""oohs and aahs"".  Things to note about beans:  rinse the black beans, just poor in the can of chili beans.  Go ahead and make the recipe as it is... it's delicious.  Over the years, however, we've made modifications: add 1 1/2 chopped orange or yellow or red bell pepper, use 15oz tomato sauce instead of just 8oz, go ahead and add a 2nd can of rinsed black beans, instead of just one.  Don't over shred the chicken, leave it a little chunky; the chicken is so moist and delicious that you'll appreciate the bigger bites.  Plus, if you over shred, the chicken tends to soak up too much of the moisture which is a less desirable texture.  For the beer, we use amber ale, or if you can find it, our favorite is ""Two Hearted"" IPA.&amp;[A keeper!,Crowd-pleaser,Easy to follow,Great flavors,Family favorite]</p>"

Very few people will even notice the taste of beer, but I would say it is another one of the things that makes this recipe so good!</p><p>_________________________</p><p>This is excellent just the way it is, so BEFORE making changes, try it first as it is originally prepared.<br />Everyone tends to think that every change makes it better... or ""I didn't have chicken so I used tofu"" or ""I didn't have black pepper so I just doubled the salt..."" etc. DON'T MAKE CHANGES and then claim that ""NOW it's perfect."" It doesn't need them and there's a very good chance that you only made it worse. Then (after trying your tofu and double salt mistake) you can follow-it-up with a review that gives it one star and says ""I didn't like it... way too salty and the fake chicken tasted like tofu."" BETTER YET, if you're going to change the recipe KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. Don't add your comments to the reviews, it can be your own secret family recipe that no one needs to know about. Thanks!</p>"

Also, I added it to the pot the same time that I added my veggies and curry. I wanted the chicken to get a chance to really get the curry flavor also thighs have some fat on them so I wanted the veggies to get some chicken fat flavor while sauteing. I also doubled the amount of curry used.</p><p>Everything else is by the recipe. I decided to used basmati rice for this dish and it came out really well.

I substituted sweet potatoes for regular potatoes and left the rice out - I would cook it separately for people to choose how much they like. Or I serve it with bread or crackers. I used peeled Granny Smith apples and tripled the amount asked for. I had toasted sweeten coconut soaked in the cream and added them together.

Today I was in a bit of a time crunch so I tried cooking it In the crock pot and it came out so well. If you’re interested in starting this before work and finishing it when you get home, here is how I did it. I threw the uncooked veggies, (raw) chicken and broth all inside the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Then when I got home I threw some butter In a sauce pan and made the roux with all of the spices. I dumped that into the crock pot with rice and the apple to finish the recipe. Add the cream before serving (when the rice is cooked) and bon Appetite.</p>"

I used a half cup of half and half at the end, instead of a cup of heavy cream. I used regular curry instead of the hot stuff, so I wouldn’t want to dilute the soup any more than that. I think, if I did, I wouldn’t taste the curry. If you use regular curry, like I did, I would suggest adding a little heat/pepper. I also used jasmine rice, which I think was a good choice. The almond flavor it has went well with the curry and apples. I added extra apples because that’s one of my favorite parts of this soup. This recipe doesn’t include an ingredient that’s been in the Mulligatawny I’ve had in the past:  diced tomatoes. It’s a really tasty addition to the soup. The tomatoes and apples have a nice contrast that works well with the curry. Last, but not least, I made this vegetarian by using Better Than Bouillon Not Chicken Broth Concentrate and Sweet Earth Mindful Chikn. It was great! A very comforting winter dinner. I’ll be saving this in my Favorites folder to make it often.</p>"

I doubled this recipe so that we could have some now and another premade meal for next week. I cooked the chicken breasts in the *organic* chicken broth most of the morning, then shredded it and added it back in with sauteed celery (I used half of one large bunch), fresh onion, garlic, carrots (about a cup, that I ran through the food processor), the mushrooms and the rice mix, that I cooked seperately (I did not want the rice to expand too much in my broth plus I've had really bad luck when I've tried to cook rice in soups, it almost never turns out and I get raw rice--I also used Uncle Ben's rice). I took half of the soup out of the crockpot so I could freeze it as I didn't want to freeze it with the cream in it. With the half I didn't freeze, I then added the milk (I used fat free evaporated milk to cut back on some of the calories), a little thyme, red pepper flake, and a drained/rinsed can of corn. Very simple, adapted well to changes and came out very flavorful. Wonderful for a cold and rainy night. The house smelled like comfort. I'll make this again. NOTE: This soup is missing something. Cheese? Maybe a little parmesan? I think that might be a good addition to this soup.</p>"

I did make a couple of  minor changes after reading that some reviewers found the flavors a bit bland.  Instead of using plain salt on my chicken, I sprinkled it liberally with Montreal chicken seasoning. Also, instead of adding ½ cup of water to the stuffing mixture, I added ½ cup of  unsalted chicken stock. Then because I saw several reviews that said it was a bit dry, I drizzled some additional chicken stock (maybe a couple of tablespoons) after I mixed in the ½ cup of stock and tomatoes, just in case, as it did appear to look a little dry. The final product was pretty good with a perfect mixture of crunch on top, moist stuffing underneath and flavorful chicken bites.&amp;[A keeper!]</p>"

What a lot of other people have said is true: it tastes nothing like bruschetta, but more like an Italian-flavored chicken casserole. It's pretty good, but not as advertised.</p><p>I also saw a lot of complaints about things being too salty or flavorless. To avoid your dish being overly salty, do NOT use any kind of stuffing mix that already has flavor added to it. Find the kind that's very plain, as in no seasoning at all. Most stuffing mixes already have seasoning in them, and they can be pretty salty, as they're meant to pair with a meat that has little flavor. Using plain, unseasoned stuffing will allow you to season the dish to your preference. I highly recommend using a salt, pepper, and garlic blend to season the stuffing. Adding some grated parmesan cheese doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>As for the moistness of the stuffing, the trick is to have it fairly saturated with the tomato liquid/water, but not sopping wet to the point that it's mushy. If it looks a little dry to you, add a little more liquid. I actually added a little bit more water just before the dish went into the oven. The result was a top that was kind of crunchy, with the stuffing underneath being perfectly moist.</p><p>A possibly relevant point on the stuffing: I used Alexa's Gluten-Free Plain Stuffing and cool water, instead of the boiling water that is usually called for.</p><p>Do not just sprinkle the chicken with salt and Italian seasoning; instead, put your cut up chicken in a bowl, add a touch of oil, and use that same salt, garlic, and pepper blend, in addition to the Italian seasoning, and then toss to coat. You basically only want enough oil to help the seasoning stick. There shouldn't be any excess oil at the bottom of the bowl after you're done seasoning the chicken.</p><p>I also wouldn't put the cheese on top of the chicken. Instead, mix both the chicken and the stuffing together, put it in your baking dish, bake it for about 20-25 minutes. Then pull the dish, add the cheese, and allow it to melt on top for the last 5-10 minutes of baking.</p><p>When I prepared the chicken bake this way, it came out pretty good. Everyone went back for seconds and thirds.&amp;[OK with tweaks]</p>"

Rather than sprinkling the cheese on top of the chicken followed by seasoning, mix everything together in a bowl then place the entire mixture on top of the chicken.  I also used a 30 oz can of tomatoes.  After all, tomatoes make the bruschetta.  Don’t forget to season with black pepper.

It might be a bit salty for some, but you can control that by using low-sodium canned tomatoes and less salt than called for. Baking it for 30 minutes was sufficient, but you have to dig into the casserole to check that the chicken is done because it's sitting at the bottom of the dish.

Full disclosure: I seasoned the the cubed chicken breast with Italian seasoning and salt first thing so it could marinate while I worked on everything else. I ended up using one can of fire roasted tomatoes because that's what we had on hand. I also used half water and half olive oil. I added in a chopped onion for good measure as well. Used cheddar instead of mozzarella because again... it's what we had available. Sprinkled some cheese on top of chicken and again on top of stuffing and also sprinkled some italian seasoning over everything.   Baked at 400 for 45 mins and all in all I'd say this was a BIG HIT!</p>

Followed suggestions of others:  omitted seasoning chicken with salt.  Used combo of garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning and seasoned pepper from Penzies and crushed red pepper.  Eyeballed all seasonings...if you like things milder go easy on the red pepper, but can’t imagine not using at least some unless there are very sensitive taste buds.
Used around 12 oz of mozzarella.

No water at all - used only olive oil - eyeballed it - probably about 1/4 cup maybe.  Drained the diced tomatoes too.
Poured a bit of olive oil on top - just a bit.

Wasn’t soggy at all!
Very very easy!!!  Great for a weeknight meal and imagine it would be a hit at pot licks too.  Enjoy!</p>"

You’ll spend at least twenty minutes just rolling the tortillas and meat mix, likely longer if your new to that technique (warm the tortillas prior to rolling).

Do yourself a favor and just use store bought egg roll wrappers. Much easier to work with than tortillas and no need for time in the freezer. You only need about a 1/2 inch of oil to fry, just enough to cover one half of your eggrolls, since you be flipping them over to cook both sides. Tongs work well for this. My family hates beans so I like to throw in fresh diced tomatoes. Bacon is good too. I also make a sauce for inside using mayo, lime juice, fresh diced cilantro, garlic, and finely diced (jarred) jalapeños. I save extra sauce for dipping later. These are also great with shrimp instead of chicken.</p>"

Marinated chicken overnight, then browned and chopped them up, added it to the skillet with the rest of the ingredients and seasonings. 

Rolled it up in egg rolls and baked it in light virgin oil for 15 minutes, then flipped it over and cooked it an extra 10 min on 350. The shells were nice and semi crunchy. It's an excellent recipe but it will be better next time as I now know what to do. Used honey mustard dipping sauce and ranch for dipping. It was a hit and everyone loved it.

1. Make sure you add plenty of veggies. Use a whole bag of spinach, chopped up, trust me on this one. The spinach will shrink so you'll need enough.

2. To get the best out of this meal, use the original eggrolls instead of tortillas; if you use the tortillas, make sure they are thin because I used regular but I most definitely prefer the eggrolls.

3. Make some chicken fried rice with this as it will a great meal. This recipe is dead on, it tastes just like the egg rolls from chili's. You will love it.</p>"

I was trying to use up egg roll wrappers that I had leftover after making pork egg rolls, so that is one change I made.  I baked them at 450 for 13 minutes.  Although they were delicious, they would have been better fried and I might just go for it next time.  I just didn't want to deal with the mess.   If I was in a hurry I'd bake them again but brush oil on the outside of the wrapper first.  I used 1/3 cup of filling per wrapper and yielded 12 egg rolls.  Made the dipping sauce suggested by one of the top reviewers.  They were delicious and very much like those made famous by a certain restaurant!</p>"

The brand I used is a little thicker. It was difficult to get them to roll as I wanted them to. The rolls ended up being a little thicker than I would have liked so I covered them and put them in the oven for a bit to make sure they were cooked all the way through. Totally my fault and not an issue with the recipe! Great recipe! Will definitely make again!</p>

First of all, I forgot to grab spinach, so I saved myself another trip to the grocery store and made do without. It was just fine without, although I don't doubt spinach would be great in it as well. 

Secondly, the chicken I used happened to be leftover from the night before. A large chicken breast injected with a mixture of store-bought butter injection and store-bought garlic injection (about half and half). Lightly seasoned on top with salt and herbs, baked for 15 minutes. Then had extra injection spooned on top the chicken and baked for another 10 minutes. I shredded it instead of cubed it, and it was still so juicy and tender even after a day in the fridge. 

Lastly, like most people, I used eggroll wrappers instead of tortillas. I did fry mine because I wanted them a little crispier. But next time I will try baking, as it seemed to retain a tad too much grease when frying (that could have easily been my fault. I don't know). 

Dipped in ranch, these were so, so amazing. Just as good as the ones you buy from Chili's. Cannot WAIT to make these again, and look forward to bringing them to parties.</p>"

I'm not a big fan of corn anyway.  I added salt and a dash of cayenne pepper to the marinade and used Hatch hot sauce.  I microwaved sweet potato and added a little butter (and the heavy whipping cream)when i mixed it. That was Devine.  I had chicken breast pieces so marinated them then put it all in a pan. When chicken was done I strained off oil and added a slurry to thicken sauce.<br />The recipe as is sounds delicious which is why I tried it. I'm sure if I followed directions it would be just as good as what I made.<br />Next time I'll add a little more salt to marinade and maybe a bit more cayenne. I doubt I'll ever do the corn part but that's just my taste.<br />Overall it was simple to make and my husband loved it. He'd prolly love it more with the corn but that's not going to happen lol.&amp;[Easy to follow]</p>

I made it by mashing the yams, corn, and cream in a pot instead of using a blender.  I also put the marinade ingredients into a Ziploc bag, mixed it by squeezing, then added the chicken instead of mixing the marinade in a bowl.  Less mess that way.  I used cream but milk would work fine.  You can mix corn into the yams or not.  Either way would be fine.  I used skinless boneless filets.  They cooked faster and were still yummy.  Grilling bone-in chicken without burning it requires about an hour of constant attention.  My way was easier.  This recipe is worth keeping for the marinade alone.  This marinade is going into my regular rotation.  Marinade Tip:  Poke skinless chicken several times with a fork to allow it to soak up marinade better.  2 hrs soaking is enough.  All day soaking is fine but it's no better than 2 hrs.</p>"

To cut down on total cooking time, cook the sweet potatoes in the microwave (opposite sides for 5-7 mins each; remember to poke the skin with a fork beforehand!), and I cooked the corn in a toaster over to avoid using the oven altogether.</p>"

Although I did do a few things differently (I used half and half rather than heavy cream, used a bag of frozen corn rather than ears, used boneless skinless chicken breasts, added 3 tablespoons of butter to the sweet potato mix, and I put about a teaspoon of salt into the marinade,) I think next time I make it I will add more chili powder, more hot sauce, and maybe some cayenne powder into the marinade.  I also think I would put a dash of chili powder on top of the corn along with the salt and pepper, and might try experimenting with a dash or so of cinnamon in the sweet potato mix.  With these changes, this recipe is certainly deserving of 5 stars!

Anyone who complains about it being too soggy or mushy, did not watch their broth. As with ANY homemade stuffing recipe, the amount of broth you use is subjective to the bread pieces you use. If you have homemade bread cubes, usually need less broth, this goes for ""Grocery store made"" ones as well. If using a commercial cube, like brown berry, than more broth is needed. There is nothing wrong with the recipe, it is user error. Not paying attention to Step 4, where you only need enough broth to moisten the bread, and instead just dumped the 4 1/2 cups in.

This recipe was easy to follow.  I made a half batch and followed the recipe aside from the addition of 1/2 of a diced Honey Crisp apple (which I would repeat). Because I made just a half batch, it needed just 2 hours on low (after the initial 45 mins on high).  In the final hour, I also folded in some diced up cooked turkey and made it a one-pot meal.   Next time I'll add oysters. Then breakfast sausage. Maybe some cranberries or almonds. Hmmm. (Note: Regarding the 7c. dried bread cubes, I used half Dark Brown Steakhouse-type (dense) bread, and half Sweet Hawaiian-type rolls.  And I would suggest that to others.)<br />A few weeks after the above review, I have an addendum:  Since I had such a success with this delicious recipe a few weeks ago, I decided to try additional ingredients.  The Sage Breakfast Sausage was a hit as was the addition of 1-2 cups of fresh uncooked cranberries to go along with the Honey Crisp apple.  I may change up the proteins from time to time, but I will never make this dressing without the apple and the cranberries as it added great flavor.  Additionally, if you wish for a dressing/stuffing that is a little less moist, once it comes out of the slow cooker put it in a shallow dish and into a hot oven (375 for 15-20 mins) till the top crisps a bit and it dries out somewhat.  Watch that it doesn't burn.  So yummy.</p>"

I still have the original recipe from way back then with many notes scribbled on it from over the years. The All Recipes recipe is exactly the same as the original Crockpot recipe so I've stapled mine together in my recipe file. Please note, the recipe calls for 4 1/2 cups chicken broth, OR AS NEEDED.  It all depends on what type of bread cubes you use so don't add it all at once. You might choose to make your own or buy the store made bags found in the bakery. For convenience I suggest using the bakery bags of bread cubes rather than making your own. If you do choose to make your own use plain white bread and don't try to make it ""healthier"" by substituting whole wheat bread for white. And by all means, DO NOT USE A PREMADE STUFFING MIX!!! I've also discovered that the newer crockpots burn hotter on the backside. There are work arounds for that but you'll need to research them on your own but think foil collar.<br />Happy Thanksgiving!</p>"

If your bread is fresh and not dry, then you shouldn’t use as much broth. I take fresh bread cubes, toast them in the oven for about 20 mins at 350 degrees (so it resembles croutons, but still a bit soft in the middle). It gives the bread a nice toasted flavour and allows you to regulate the moisture better by adding broth as it cooks.<br />The slow cooker  can burn the bread as it cooks so mix it every 20 mins and add broth as you need it…don’t add the whole 4 1/2 cups at once, I usually start with half. *Dry bread, and add broth as it cooks. Enjoy!</p>"

I usually do stuffing from scratch and stuff the bird but this time I prepped my turkey different and could not stuff him.  I was concerned my family wouldn't like it as much as mine but they did. Only difference is that I boiled the neck/innards in a pot and chopped those up and added to stuffing.  Also used the water from cooking the neck as the broth.  I also increased some of the spices because we really like flavor and it worked great.  Allrecipes is one of my favorite places to go when I want something new; which I always like to give my family new things to try.<br />The one thing I recommend highly is the lining of the slow cooker as it can get a little toasty/crispy on the sides (a good thing) but clean up would be a bear if you didn't line it.</p>

And it was as tasty as my regular in the bird bread stuffing. Use turkey bone broth if you can find it. Much better than chicken broth to go with our Thanksgiving dinner.</p>"

Made this a number of times. I don't need Thanksgiving or Christmas or any holiday to make stuffing. This recipe goes great with turkey, pork, chicken or just about anything! I use the full recipe as listed (I halve the salt) and have discovered that the bread cubes really determine the real quality of the stuffing. I first used Pepperidge Farms Sage and Onion mix (which was good), then a number of different kinds of bread mixed together, and finally Chicago bread from Publix (best in my opinion). I slice it, cube it, and let it dry in the oven (no heat) for a few days. I do add all of the spices plus a pinch of caraway seeds and 2 cloves of minced garlic (at the end of the sauteeing) to the skillet with onions, celery, and parsley to allow the spices to bloom. Everything else is the same: stirring every hour (lightly so as not to mush), dish towel to absorb moisture, watching the amount of broth, starting on the high setting, etc. Four hours on low is plenty.  I have forgotten the eggs on occasion and don't use mushrooms. I vacuum seal and freeze the leftovers (I'm cooking for 1) in single serving portions (1 cup) and have multiple meals in the future. Wonderful recipe!

Additional comment: For turkey stuffing, add 3-4 T. drippings (with fat, it's flavor) to stuffing and lightly stir to mix. Do not compress, it can get mushy.</p>"

I started this before work and let it go the full 8 hours. I don't think that you need to put it on high at the beginning if you plan on the longer cooking time. I did cook up pound of Jimmy Dean sausage and added it too. I also added 2 tsp of garlic to the vegetable mixture. I also agree with other reviewers concerning the amount of broth depending on the type of bread cubes that you use. I used packed very dry bread cubes so I did need all of the broth. We love mushrooms so I may increase the amount next time.</p>

Having read several of the reviews, I paid attention to type of bread and the amount of chicken stock used.  I had a drier-style sourdough bread, and the amount of stock was appropriate for it.

My slow cooker tends to cook somewhat hot, even on the Low setting, and this may have skewed the results somewhat.  I cooked it for 4 hours on Low, without a starting High setting phase, and it came out rather over-cooked (to the point where the bread was breaking down--dissolving is too strong a term, but you get my meaning).  I was checking /stirring every hour, and about the 2 hour point would have been perfect.

All this having been said, the balance of flavors was excellent, and with the adjustments I think are needed, will make an excellent dish.</p>"

I actually didn't measure the broth but added throughout the cooking as needed.  Also, I used a tea towel to absorb the condensation so the stuffing didn't  get to mushy.  I stirred the stuffing and switched out the tea towel every hour.  (only used two towels as one dried while the other was absorbing).  I dried my own bread crumbs for a few days, which I think makes a difference.  You really can tweak this recipes to your own liking.  By adding ingredients or omitting to suit your own tastes.  I used less poultry seasoning and added pork sausage, shredded carrots and turkey drippings.  Everyone loved it!!</p>"

I took the suggestion of the towel under the lid, which makes sense because you don’t want that extra liquid dripping into your stuffing. I could only find the hard seasoned cubed bread crumbs, so I cut back on the sage, thyme and salt. I took the suggestions of only starting with half the broth. I checked it after two hours to stir and added more broth as needed. After that I checked hourly,  stirring and adding more broth the longer it cooked. Mine was perfect after  4-5 hours. I wouldn’t recommend cooking it longer, it  will just make it cook down and intensify your seasoning.  I found this out the hard way after having to keep it warm for an additional 2 hours  unexpectedly.  Overall great recipe.</p>"

The only changes were using 1/4 cup butter instead of 1/3 because some people said it was too buttery; I don't think it really made a difference,  and doubling the topping, which seems standard.  I cooked on high for 1 hour, and then low 2hours.  It was just getting to the point where it would burn at the edges.  I didn't use a liner, but just soaked the crockpot for a bit and it was easy to clean up.  I was nervous to try a new recipe at a holiday meal, but so glad I did.</p>"

This is definitely going to be filed under ""must-have"" for future holiday and dinner gatherings where sweet potatoes are a must.

One note was that I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and if it was to cook any longer, it probably would've burned some.  Next time I want to try cooking it on low instead, I think that just may make it PERFECT! :)</p>"

I followed the advice of others and baked 6 SP on 400 for 75 minutes , then peeled and mashed them instead of using the canned yams.  Wouldn't think of going back to canned ever again! Also on the advice of others, I added an extra T of reg &amp; brown sugars and doubled the topping.  Set on High for 3 hours and added marshmallows (to half) during the last 45 minutes.

It was Turkey Day for just me and my husband, and he doesn't particularly LIKE sweet potatoes, so I felt free to improvise and omit what I didn't have and what I didn't like!  I did NOT use the pecans, or any sugar.  In a large bowl, I just mashed the ONE can of sweet potatoes (again, it was just for the 2 of us), added a tablespoon of melted margarine, a tablespoon of orange juice, ONE egg, NO milk, no flour, and sprayed the slow cooker with olive oil to grease.  I took a lot of people's advice:  Cooked on high for 2 hours, turned to low the 3rd hour, and also at the beginning of the 3rd hour, I covered the entire top of the sweet potatoes with LARGE marshmallows (they melted into the potatoes).  What a wonderful flavor!  I definitely will make this again!  Of COURSE I gave it 5 stars, because I didn't make it as written.  (If I had made it EXACTLY as written and THEN didn't like it, I THEN would have decreased the number of stars!  How can ANYONE give a recipe less than 5 stars if they don't make it EXACTLY as written???  I am still mystified by that!)</p>"

But in all fairness; I’m not vegan, vegetarian, on Keto or any special diet. But, I like to work meatless Monday’s into many of my weekly menu plans and am always on a the lookout for recipes that qualify - or closely do. I figured I’d try this (recognizing this has bacon and cream of chicken).  Has all the ingredients I love! Cauliflower? Check! Cheese? Check! Green onions? Check! But I found this to be a great side dish...but not something I want to eat as a main meal.  I think it could be good or more well rounded by adding chicken as another suggested (I followed the recipe exactly). I also think adding jalapeños while cooking the cauliflower might add some fun heat! I noted water after cooking but once stirred in; not soupy or watery at all! I cooked for two hours exactly, left on warm while we served and stirred a couple times and the all water/cheese/soup mixed in well - as if it were never there. I would make again but likely to compliment another dish like pork chops or chicken (in which case, I would omit chicken from crockpot but will still consider adding jalapeños!).  Glad I tried.

23020029,6569022,MARY DOMAZ,5,2,0,1553185170290,https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/278426,"<p>This dish came out light and fluffy and very tasty. However, I am not sure crock pots are the best way for me to make egg casseroles. When eggs cook too long, they water out and that is exactly what happened to mine. When I got home and checked the temperature of the center, it was 190 degrees. When I bake egg casseroles in the oven, I take them out when they reach 165 and never have trouble with watered out casseroles. Had I been home and caught this dish at the right temperature, I feel confident there would have been no watering out. Now, I must say I did not add the flour, and I am ""guessing"" that may keep this recipe from getting watery in a crock pot. I just wasn't willing to put flour in my egg casserole. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the taste and texture of the dish. It was a winner recipe. Next time I will add some roasted red peppers to just give it added color. I do disagree with the 15 minute prep time. I assumed the contributor of the recipe meant for you to chop the spinach, even though it was not mentioned. If you do that, there is no way I can prepare this dish in 15 minutes. Plus I grate my own cheese since I do not like the ingredients that are added to pre-grated cheese to keep it from sticking together.  I will continue to make this recipe, but will prepare it in the oven. It was truly an amazing dish and I just loved the taste.  It will make a great brunch recipe for company. If you don't mind using flour, and the flour </p>"
23463859,6569022,Barbara Moore,5,1,0,1553133626290,https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1245074,<p>I made changes that didn't work well. The  casserole itself was good without my substitutions. I used a 6 qt. crock pot. Six hours is just right on this casserole. I had to get up early to turn It off.  Don't let it cook to long or it will brown too much. I used fresh spinach I chopped up. I substituted gluten free flour for wheat flour. Also I had two extra eggs so I tossed them in also.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added turkey bacon and jimmy dean turkey sausage. That was my mistake. I will use Hillshire turkey kielbasa sausage next time. I don't think the ricotta made a difference.</p>

Update, for a 6 quart Instant Pot: set for medium saute, add half the butter and the onions, add the mushrooms after a few minutes, no need to fully cook, just take the edge off the onions. Turn off the pot and add remaining butter and let the spinach wilt in the pot as it cools down. This makes everything fit in the pot easier. Prepare other ingredients, (I used 8 eggs and added 1/4 tsp cayenne), mix in sauteed veggies and their liquid. Pour back into Instant Pot. Slow-cook on low for 7-9 hours using the standard lid or a glass one.</p>"

I stayed right with the ingredients as I do the first time with every recipe as to be able to truly rate the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I baked it instead of crock pot.  I think this helped with the runnyness. No need to cut back on milk this way.  The reason for the 4 is that I could see it being runny if in a crock pot due to it being closed top and frozen beans...to much water and also I would have liked just a little more flavor.  The chicken soup thought made me wonder a little but it worked.  Next time I'll probably add some onion powder like many had mentioned doing in former reviews.</p>

22947026,6650728,Michelle Finley Baker,4,2,0,1514083931377,https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/bakermichelle,"<p>I don’t think this tastes as good as the traditional recipe with canned green beans but if you are in need of oven space it is ALMOST just as good.  I doubled the recipe for a large gathering and it fit nicely in a 6 quart crockpot.  Initially I thought it would be too full, but it cooked down considerably.   I think it is necessary to have frozen green beans instead of canned for the crockpot so it doesn’t get mushy or soupy.  And mine turned out the perfect consistency with the recipe written as is.  There is NOT too much milk and I don’t know how anyone would suggest that unless they altered the recipe by using canned beans.  I did use half mushroom soup and half chicken soup.  I did add a few teaspoons of soy sauce.  I will DEFINITELY make this again any time I want oven space or to prepare a dish well in advance!  I also found it better to cook on HIGH for 4 hours instead of low, stirring every now and then, and adding the onions on top at the end when serving.</p>"

I used a cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup because that's what I had.  We fed 14 people, which was more than enough with all the other food.

It can be cooked longer, especially if you use chunky hash browns rather than the shredded ones.

The air whipped into it made the final result more than 2"" high in a standard oval crockpot. This kept in the moisture very well. The sausage moved up to just under the cheese crust and it was yummy. 

I might try the sausage in uncooked so those oils go into the hash browns. 

Could try peppers or other veggies mixed in with the hash browns</p>"

I used cooked bacon instead of sausage. It tasted like it needed something extra but it might because I didn't use sausage. Still tasted pretty good. Will use sausage next time I make.</p>

No worries with this one.  I chose to use canadian bacon as my protein and added diced onion and yellow red peppers.  As I was preparing it, I had leftover Russian Cheese Salad (mozz/mayo/garlic) from this site, so I added that as well, and I'm glad I did.  The garlic really made this sing.  This is easily customizable and came together in mere minutes.  It's not the most visually appealing if you're looking to impress with presentation, but it was really nice not having to preheat the oven and wait an hour for a traditional breakfast casserole to cook.  This will be one of my staple overnight guest breakfasts.  THANKS for the recipe!</p>"

When shopping for the teriyaki sauce I looked them all over. There are some for a marinade which is very thin and looks like soy sauce. I choose a higher end which was for cooking. The consistency was very thick. Made the recipe as directed but  added a little more ginger and extra green onion for the finish. While this was cooking I tasted it and it was very salty. Luckily,  I had saved some pineapple juice and threw a hefty splash in. That was enough to save this dish. I might make it again but, will always add extra pineapple juice.

Gound turkey instead of ground beef,

1 tbsp minced garlic instead of garlic powder
1 med-large chopped onion instead of onion powder
Heavy cream instead of milk

I sauteed the garlic and onions, then added the meat to that pan, seasoned, used the stock to deglaze and went from there.

There's so much you can do to make this into something your family will love!! I'm a seasoned cook, so I knew it was under seasoned; and a can of plain petite tomatoes is so boring. I used a can of rotel and can of green chilis, along with a couple tablespoons of spicy salsa. I make my own taco seasoning mix, so I can cut back on the salt, but up the different spices. I like to add some chipotle powder, and smoky paprika to my mix. And I used chicken broth instead of water. I made some taco salad shells, and we had taco salads with the mix, and the family loved it. Lettuce on the bottom, the beef and rice mixture, some refried beans, chopped tomatoes, shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream, salsa, and jalapenos.

I have a bottle of ""Tex Mex"" spice mix which I used instead of the taco mix and, uncertain of what an ounce amounted to, I put in about 1.5 Tbsp. That was about right for us; it gave it a little zip. I also upped the rice to 2 scant cups, knowing my family's appetite, and added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes w/chilies to adjust for the increased rice. As is my habit, I also substituted broth for the water (in this case, beef broth). This recipe's definitely a keeper, as multiple family members have already requested that I make it again!</p>"

The only thing in this recipe that might identify it as Mexican is something called ""taco seasoning"".  This, of course, is a north of the border made up thing.  Also, we don't use tomatoes in our cooking, only in salsa or pico de gallo.  If you make up your own spice/herb mix you can make it to your taste and add as needed, here is my suggestion:  cumin, chile powder or prepared dried chiles, oregano (Greek or Mexican which is very strong), salt and sometimes cilantro (and  in pico de gallo). We are old school and do not use garlic.  Some of the ingredients used in modern Mexican cooking have been fused with Italian thanks to people who know nothing about Mexican cooking.  We use recipes primarily handed down by hubby's mom.  He loved her cooking, now he loves mine</p>"

Instead of fresh zucchini I used a frozen zucchini blend, and in place of a whole onion I used around a 1/4th or 1/3rd (basically used what I had leftover in the fridge.) The only thing I have to comment on was the amount of olives. 6 ounces of olives is a lot of olives, personally, so I think next time I'm only going to put in 3oz. I like olives but 6oz is a tad bit too much. Other than that, this was absolutely delicious. I'm definitely gonna make this again!!&amp;[Great flavors,A keeper!,Easy to follow,Crowd-pleaser]</p>"

I omitted the olives and substituted the cheddar cheese for grated Parmesan. But whatever kind of cheese you choose, I would only sprinkle it on when serving, and would not mix it into the skillet (especially if you plan on reheating any leftovers). Jumping back to the beginning: To reserve the flavor of the onion and garlic, I first brown the ground beef then drain it and set it aside, then in a little bit of oil I sauté the onion and garlic in the skillet for a few minutes before mixing them all together. My hubby added red pepper flakes to spice up his own plate. I loved it too, and will definitely make this “minimal-mess”, versatile dish again.</p>"

That was my first shortcut, using cold cooked potatoes. I cut them up and added them to the skillet after browning the meat, then added the dry seasonings. I didn't have Ro-tel or O'Brien potatoes, but I did have salsa which is tomatoes, green chiles, and onion, so shortcut number 2. I only had a little onion left, so I chopped it up and added it in. I added in some pimento from a jar for the green peppers, shortcut #3. I had all the components, just in slightly different form. Home cooking is all about  using what you've got. I wrapped this in a Zero Carb flour tortilla for a nice hot meal. This was on the dry side, so it could use some crema or a super melty creamy cheese like Velveeta. I scaled this down to make 1 serving so 4 oz. of beef, and I had 4 potato wedges that I chopped up. This gave me two picadillo and cheese tacos and I have enough left for two more.

This was easy and went from start to finish in less than thirty minutes. I salted the beef when it was browning, and added a little more cheese than called for. I was out of sour cream, but next time, we'll have it on top too. I scaled this down and made half. This is a great way to stretch that ground beef out and you could even get more servings by increasing the tortillas and the beans. I only used half the salsa called for since it wasn't a mild salsa and it looked like plenty. We enjoyed this dish very much.</p>"

It’s customizable if you want it to be; you can substitute pinto or refried beans if you prefer. You can add onions or peppers to the beef sauce. You can add olives, jalapeños or green chilies to the simmer/saute. All will turn out with good results. Me personally, I sautéd onions with the beef. When I added all the ingredients in step 2, I also added a 4os can of jalapeños and a 4oz can sliced black olives. I simmered on low for 15 min before stirring in the tortilla strips - simmered another 5 minutes and then added the cheese. When I added the cheese, I covered and turned off the heat. I let sit for 5 more min so all the cheese would be ooey gooey melty. This was very good and again, so easy! Thanks Aaron!</p>"

The first problem is the order in which they say to put everything in a Dutch Oven.  If you put a large head of cabbage (thinly sliced) in a Dutch Oven it is overflowing before adding beef, tomatoes, onions, etc.  Second, the recipe says only to cook on low.  It never says to raise the temperature.  If you put cabbage on the bottom of a Dutch oven with the tomatoes, onions, and beef on top, it will never cook (correctly) in 45 minutes.  Overall the ratio of cabbage to beef was way off.  It needed at least 2-3X more beef.  As for taste it was ok.  Not good.  Not bad.  But the recipe clearly needs to be rewritten.  Won't make this again.&amp;[Confusing directions,Needs improvement]</p>"

This is a little sweet, a little spicy, and a lot of delicious. I had day old rice I wanted to use and that was easier to heat through by dumping it in the pan too. I did cut this recipe in half. Since I only had freeze dried chives instead of fresh green onion, I did toss a good pinch of  dried minced onion in the beef to compensate for the onion flavor. I didn't use all the beef called for, so this was saucy on purpose, and then when I added the rice, it came out perfect. I used 3 cups of cooked rice in total to 1/3 lb. beef. I didn't add the sesame oil until the end though as the heat breaks down the oil and I didn't want to compromise it. This smelled so good and I was so ready to eat, that I almost forgot the toasted sesame seeds on top. This is a winner!</p>"

The dish benefited from the added spice, but more importantly from the added depth of flavor.</p><p>Served over rice as commended and the dish is salty, despite using low sodium soy sauce, but the rice balanced it out.

I read some negative comments but keep in mind Korean cuisine is many small dishes and not one main dish.  If you think too much salt then substitute water for some of the soy sauce.

I read reviews b4 I made it &amp; made the following adjustments:<br />I only had preminced garlic, so used that to my preferred taste (~1.5-2tsp = 3-4 cloves).<br />Added thinly sliced carrots, lightly steamed broccoli florets &amp; the white parts of the sliced green onion during the simmering process (but might wait til the end bc I like them raw). I added the sesame oil near the end of cooking to preserve the flavor.<br />NOTE ABOUT BROWN SUGAR: Idk the flavor prof of people who reduced the sugar to 1 Tbsp (they may not be very good cooks), but if u do, prepare for it to be incredibly SALTY! I had to add honey after it was cooked to tame the saltiness.<br />Next time I make it, I'll add at least 3 Tbsp of brown sugar &amp; more red pepper flakes (or Sriracha/Sambal Oelek) bc I didnt notice any heat or kick to it.<br />Make sure u taste it after it's been simmering for a few minutes to ensure u like the flavor profile, that way u have time to adjust b4 it's finished.

Left out the vodka - seemed extraneous. Prepared buttered flat egg noodles and served them separately (lengthens cooking time for sauce and more thickening flour) to give guests more options in the sauce/noodle ratio. Added a teaspoon of smoked paprika sprinkled on the sauce just before serving. IMHO that subtle flavor was as good as any sherry or brandy flavor could have imparted. Served a medley of roasted red potatoes, Brussels sprouts, yellow and red peppers, zucchini, and red onion on the side. My wife and I enjoyed the leftovers a couple of days later, and it was just as good or better.</p>"

I did add, per another reviewer suggestion, 2 tsp Worcestershire, 1tsp steak sauce, ¼ tsp garlic and onion and a 1/8 tsp dry mustard. I used penne pasta and it took about 12 minutes to cook.

Also, adding a tablespoon of Dijon mustard at the end is a classic element to Beef Stroganoff. 3) Take the cup of water and discard it. Prior to adding the BEEF BROTH (which is beef stock with added flavor of mirepoix) deglaze the pan with a cup of dry white wine (Kendall Jackson is a solid go to for this). 4) Skip the sour cream and use creme fraiche, not only does it mix in better but adds more depth with out overpowering the sauce like the sour cream tends to do.<br />--easy changes but well worth it, definitely will make this again.</p>"

My dorm roommate invited me for dinner at her summer apartment, near where she was working during summer break.<br />She cooked a Hamburger Helper concoction, but forgot to drain the grease from the cheap cut of ground beef meat ( we were students!)

Loved the flavors and the heat, but it was too spicy for some of my family members, so you'll want to go easy on the cayenne and black pepper if you're preparing for those that don't like spicy food. Also used way less oil for sauteeing the onions and tomatoes as someone else suggested. This was delicious with rice but would be equally enjoyable with potatoes, naan or sweet potatoes.&amp;[Great flavors,A keeper!]</p>"

After a long day decided against. As such, I subbed a 15oz can petite diced tomatoes over fresh and had to omit the peas. In their place, I chopped 1 celery stalk and added 1/2c beef broth as per the recipe tip notes. I didn’t add/use the oil - which may be why i didn’t have issues with the “fat” - and, that I browned the hamburger, onion, celery all in a single step. Only once the hamburger was browned did I add the tomatoes, spices and broth - simmered med-low for 30 min. This was PHENOMENAL! It’s borderline spicy - kind of 😉. But, your kitchen smells amazing before, during and after dinner. Served over baked rice. Many praises and thanks danie! 5 stars all the way!&amp;[A keeper!,Great flavors,Family favorite]</p>"

But there were a couple of other things that I think need to be modified. First, you don't need 6T of olive oil to saute the onion. Two or three would be sufficient, and the finished dish would be less greasy. Second, the amount of black pepper is excessive. It was the only change to the recipe I made, cutting back to 1/2 tsp. Even then I thought the pepper overwhelmed the curry powder. If I make it again I will further cut back the black pepper. Thirdly, if this isn't your first exposure to curry, and you like curry, I would increase the amount to taste. If these changes are made, I would increase the rating to 5 stars, especially since the leftovers, eaten the next day, tasted even better.</p>"

The only change up that my family prefers is that instead of green peas I add Chick Peas or Garbanzo Beans depending on what part of the Country you are in is what you call them. They give it a heartiness that we just love. You may need to add a touch more liquid if you don't care for it to be very thick.  Delicious!</p>

But I suggest that you read through the many comments about it that follow my comment from today, 9-21-22! Remember, this recipe is at least 4 years old by now, and, unlike many comments posted by allrecipes members about recipes, there are many about this recipe that I found to be very useful, and you will too!  For example, several have commented about the cooking of the ground beef! I always learn something from the many ways that home chefs claim they cook their ground beef . In this recipe, the O/P did not specify doing any draining off step, allowing the rendered fat and water to remain in the skillet. I think that ground beef loses a lot of its beefy goodness when the fat and water from the cooking gets discarded. So I no longer discard them. I make it a point, however, to allow the water to boil off, and to do this, while avoiding the burning of the ground beef on the bottom of the skillet, I apply a very old and trusted technique ..... constant stirring of the ground beef! Getting some pieces very brown, but not blackened!  Then I begin with the tomatoes and begin to cook! Thanks for listening to my comments. I make this recipe once a month, never skimping on the cayenne! Happy cooking!</p>"

I didn't add any water as my wife took pictures of the ingredients, but not the directions, on her cell phone.  She also missed the peas.  I cooked the ground beef first and used the rendered fat to cook the vegetables.  I reduced the heat and tossed in the spices.  They cooked in the rendered oil for a minutes before turning up the heat and adding the beef back (beef tallow has a higher smoke point than EVOO &amp; VOO).  When the beef had warmed up again, I reduced the heat and let the ingredients blend together.  Next time I will add a little liquid and frozen peas.  I'm not a big fan of canned peas.  Finally I quadrupled the amount of spices and stored them in a jar for quick use in the future.  As I said I really liked the balance in the mix.</p>"

The process of cooking onion first and then the rest of spices with the meat, until it has a cooked smell and the oil separates from the meat mixture, is important and has a name ( bhoonna). This can take 10-15 minutes during which the pot has to be stirred intermittently. Oil should be removed after this process to allow for proper fragrance and flavor of the dish. Because the oil separates, the spices are not lost.</p>"

There’s a lot of fat that cooks out of the ground beef that IMO needs to be drained.  The recipe doesn’t tell you to do that, but I usually do, but didn’t today. If you brown the fresh tomatoes with the meat, if you drain it, you’re losing all of that sweet juice from the tomatoes. And although the final product was very good, it was greasy. So in the future, I will brown the meat, drain the fat, and then add tomatoes along with the remaining ingredients to simmer. On the positive side, this had very different flavors which we thoroughly enjoyed, and I definitely will make it again.</p>"

After 10 minutes, the macaroni had started to stick to the pan.  II’ll start checking on doneness at 7 minutes if I make again.  I added quite a bit of chicken broth to improve consistency and threw in a handful of frozen peas and carrots to give it a pop of color.  Definitely needs another 2-3 ounces ground beef, as well as more seasoning.  I added more garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper and put some sriracha on the table.  After the cheese was melted, it was “gummy,” so more chicken broth and sour cream, and a garnish of some parsley.  I’ve never had Hamburger Helper, so I don’t know if this recipe measures up.  As written, I’d give this 3 stars, but with tweaking, it ended up 5 stars, so a 4 star rating from me.  I know I made changes, but they were necessary to salvage the dinner.  It really is an easy recipe, and I like the one-pot cleanup.  Finally, this is 5-6 servings for us, not 4, and it is a budget-friendly comfort food meal.  Apologies for the long review, but bottom line, I think it’s worth your effort to adapt to your personal taste, if necessary.&amp;[OK with tweaks,Needs more flavor,Might try again]</p>"

My only issue is that using the box is cheaper, easier, and tastes nearly the exact same. This recipe is a little more natural - but you are still using that processed cheese, which reduces the value of a 'homeade' recipe further. Good recipe, but the boxed kits are easier and you get basically the same thing.</p>"

I made a lot of changes to fit what I like and what I had on hand.  I used a pound of ground beef to start.  I ended up with about 1 1/2 cups of minced sweet onion so threw it all in.  I like the idea of cooking the macaroni with the sauteed onion and ground beef and seasonings because the pasta absorbs more flavor that way.  I used 2 teas. dry chicken bouillon, a generous few shakes of garlic salt, McCormick Steak seasoning which has various herbs, salt and pepper.  When the pasta was cooked I threw in a handful of chopped fresh parsley and 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I don't ever have Velveeta on hand.  I forgot the sour cream and it turned out wonderful anyway.  I will make again soon!</p>"

I need to call out that despite having family members that either dislike raisins and/or green olives - they all liked this! The two - plus the briny capers - balance each other out very well! My only change was to combined steps 1 &amp; 2 (why brown separately?) and I added about 1/2 c chopped fresh tomatoes (from my garden). If I could go back, I would have either added another 8oz can of tomato sauce OR double the fresh chopped tomatoes I added. I don’t think this alone had enough sauce….which! If you are making this for empanada filling, would be unnecessary, but, if serving over rice like I did, a little more sauce goes a long way.  Overall, we thought this was fantastic and I would make again! Thanks Amalloch!</p>"

There are several places to find a recipe for that if you google it.  The amount given as 1.41 oz of Goya Sazon is INCORRECT.  That is the weight of an entire box of Goya Sazon which has 8 packets in it.  Use only 2 packets of that 1.41 box if you buy Sazon.  That comes to .35 oz.

I used dark brown sugar instead of white. Added a sprinkle of Adobo sin pimiento seasoning. And used Ro*Tel “diced tomatoes &amp; green chilies” in place of tomato sauce and peppers.

You need only two of the tiny little packets that are included in the 1.41 oz box (or any sized box). 

As for the recipe, the Sazon is a great twist on a classic recipe. A little kick to a perfect recipe. I often add a little more tomato sauce and olives, unless I’m filling empanadas. 

Without raisins and adding cheese (as some suggested) it’s just not picadillo  but keep the recipe as-is and it’s authentic.</p>"

If you're inclined to make this spicier then I recommend don't. The flavor of this dish should be enjoyed on their own merits. I made just a couple of minor changes because I've had this dish many times in the past. I added two tablespoons ketchup and 1/3 cup water along with the tomato sauce, I also substituted green pepper with red pepper, just my personal preference. Last few changes I used 8 olives (with pimento) instead of 6, and a added a tablespoon of the olive juice and no capers.</p>"

I make it all the time and have been told it is as good as my Abuelas was. However, there are a couple issues with this recipe...first after browning the meat and adding onions, garlic, tomato sauce we Cubans add Vino Seco which is dry white cooking wine. Without it, it just will taste like sloppy joes. No bueno! And the raisins and capers?!?!?? no no no please don’t put them in picadillo. There are other dishes where capers are definitely used in Cuban dishes but not in this one and definitely not with raisins! And the biggest mistake would be the olives. I’m having a meltdown just typing this!Please do yourself and your dinner guests a favor and use green manzanilla olives with the little red peppers stuffed in them. Dump a whole jar in even a larger size jar! 6 would never cut it! I promise with those easy edits I just demanded you make, your picadillo will be perfect.

This does take an hour to cook, but you have only one pan to clean, it just couldn’t be simpler to make, and all ingredients are ones that I always have on hand.  Made exactly as written, tasted, and then adjusted to our personal taste by adding some sriracha and basil.  Nothing fancy here, but this is a solid weeknight meal that really does taste good.

Cook 2 medium white potatoes in water to cover until not quite done while prepping and cooking the bacon and onions.  Drain the potatoes and submerge in ice water. Drain and allow to dry somewhat. Now the peel comes off easily and dice. Add to the bacon and onion, add all the reserve clam liqueur and finish cooking until potatoes are tender. Add the clams, a cup of half and half, splash of milk, and butter to suit. Warm through. Came out great, however, had I remembered I had cooking sherry on hand, I would have added a splash of that also!</p>"

Cook bacon strips in a pan and when crispy remove. Then cook onion in the bacon grease.
Meanwhile parboil potatoes in a separate pot. Once they are fork tender, drain and add to skillet with onion. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Once onions are translucent, add potato and onion mixture back to pot used for potatoes. Add 1 and 1/2 cups of chicken stock and clam liquid, bring to simmer. Optional: mash some of the potato mixture with a masher. 
Melt four tablespoons of butter in a small pot then whisk in a quarter cup flour to make a roux. This will be used to thicken your soup. Cook for about 5 minutes on low. Gradually whisk in half and half, a little at a time, two cups total. Once all half and half is used cook on low for about 10 minutes to thicken. 
Add clams to pot then add the roux. You may want to add a little more half and half depending on the consistency you like your soup. Serve and top with crumbled bacon.</p>"

I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except I may have had a bit more than two cups of diced potatoes, so I added enough water to cover them.

The water boiled down just right with the lid off.  I had 6.5 oz. cans of clams, so I used 2 cans, about 13 ozs.  There was just over a cup of juice and I used half of it.  However, we aren’t really fond of a strong fish taste, so, the next time I make  it,  I will probably add a bit less.  I may add a little extra half and half to cut the fish taste, but, other than that, I will definitely make this recipe again.  To me, the thickness was just right.  Thanks for the recipe!</p>"

To be honest, I was searching for a good, basic chowder recipe that could be used as a foundation for other seafood chowders.  I was not disappointed.

Last night, I used tilapia which I happened to have on hand, and added 1 cup of diced peas and carrots (I reduced the number of servings to 4).

Happily, we do have some frozen shrimp and pollock that need to be used up soon.  I know exactly what I will be doing.

Besides the vegetables, the only other addition I would make is, once the soup is ladled into bowls,  garnish the chowder with oyster crackers, a traditional New England touch.</p>"

The first batch I made was a tiny bit runny for my taste, as some other people have mentioned. The second time I made it I was kind of skimpy with the water - I added a little bit under 1 1/2 cups of water to the potatoes, keeping an eye on it as it cooked in case the potatoes needed more water to cook. I set the timer for 15 minutes but after the potatoes cooked down I added a little bit more water and let them cook down again, so I cooked them for a total of about 18 minutes or so. They were very tender. After cooking down the potatoes the soup was thicker and the potatoes were plenty done enough. I think this technique is the secret to this soup.

I use this recipe as a ballpark guideline. Clearly 15 minutes is really not enough time to cook the potatoes properly.
My revisions:
I start with fresh chowder clams or cherrystones. 2 dozen. Large pot, half full of water. At least 6-8 cups. 
I boil them, one layer in shell until shell is open. I remove the clams when the shell opens, and continue until all are cooked and open. 
I set the open clams aside, and remove them from the shell. 
Chop them and add later per recipe.
I reserve ALL liquid I cooked the clams in, and I strain it through a colander lined with paper towel to remove any sand that settled. 
Reserving all strained liquid clams cooked in as the base instead of just water. 
I continue per recipe, cooking potatoes covered until cooked, then add clams, cream, butter etc. 

I also modify this recipe to make a fish chowder, and a seafood chowder as well, by adding fish/shrimp as well as the clams. 
I will also thicken with Wondra flour after the cream is warm.</p>"

I took note of some of the comments made regarding the thickness and bland potatoes. I made a few changes. I used the bacon, onions, potatoes, salt and pepper according to the recipe. I reserved a little bacon grease in a separate pan to make a roux. I added 1/2 cup of celery and carrots. I replaced the water with clam juice from a bottle and allowed my potatoes cook in the juice until tender. While that was cooking I began my roux. I melted the butter in the separate pan added flour stored until I had a light puffy sauce. This took about 5 minutes. Then I added heavy cream to the mixture. I then transferred the roux to my clams broth and seasoned to taste. OMGOODNESS was this good! It was thick and flavorful!</p>"

I used pre diced “Simply potatoes” that I cooked in the microwave for like, 3 minutes to make sure they cooked through all the way. Also added a tsp of chicken soup base to bring out the flavors. My boyfriend loved it so much it’s made it onto the regular rotation.</p>"

I replaced the water with clam juice and used 3 cans of clams instead of 2.  Everything else I kept the same.   
Some reviews said the potatoes weren't cooked enough.  I cut my potatoes the size of dice and cooked them half the time with lid off and half with lid on.  I kept them at a boil the entire time, and they were cooked perfectly in 15 minutes.  Also, Step 2 says to cook for 5 minutes or until heated through.  My chowder was still watery so I continued to stir and cook until it thickened slightly (another 5 to 10 minutes).  While stirring, I also mashed some of the potatoes with the back of my spoon against the side of the pot.  Would definitely make again.</p>"

Once falling the recipe abd using bacon and once substituting the bacon for salt pork and omitting the salt. With the salted pork it tastes more traditional but was slightly salty. It's a good recipe either way though. If I make it again ill use the pork but recipe the amount to reduce the sodium. I also soak my beans overnight in 3 5 cups of water and then add all ingredients to my crock pot and cook on high for 6-8 hours. Stir every hour and only add water towards the end if needed.

I've made these twice now, once in the oven and the second time in a slow cooker. Both methods turned out super flavourful, but I would continue to make in the slowcooker since it's less cleanup and you can set it and forget it. I soaked my beans for 2 days rather than one, but they would have been okay after 24 hours, as I really just didn't end up getting to cook them when I wanted to. My husband loves beans, and he LOVES this recipe.</p>"

My husband loved the beans, so I went with four stars.  The consistency was perfect and the recipe was easy to follow.  The cooking time was accurate.  It truly depends of the flavor of beans that you prefer.  I found these to be much too salty.  Also, be cautious of the type of bacon you use.  We used a smoked bacon, which gave the beans a smoky flavor.  So, it's really all about your flavor preference.  Just be aware that all of the bacon flavor will go directly into your beans, since the bacon is not precooked or drained.  I will definitely make these again, with some adjustments.  Overall, a very nice recipe.</p>"

These were out of this world! Everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper!</p>
26846002,6740861,vic1995740il,5,0,0,1596428780440,,<p>Delicious! Traditional. The recipe instructs using seasoning salt when broiling the oysters and also salting the paste. I would use either one or the other but not both next time. I also felt that I added too much bread crumbs. I’d use less. All said this is an outstanding recipe. Highly recommended.</p>

First time I've ever made oysters, and this really wasn't as much work as I thought it would be after I wrapped my noodle (brain) around it. I'm Celiac, and omitted the beer.

I had these huge, beautiful oysters that were already shucked, so I had no shells to use as the base. I found a recipe for ""Naked"" Oysters Rockefeller and use a muffin pan to create individual servings.  I was able to track down all of the specified cheeses, so the ingredients were on target. 

My disappointment could absolutely be the result of those changes or the already-shucked oysters, but... the oyster flavor was lost amongst the spinach filling. The flavor of the filling was just ok. The take-away from this feedback is to limit the amount of filling that you put on the oyster. The instructions indicate you should just fill the shell so I put on what I thought was a commensurate amount (looking at the picture). 

I'd like to try it again, verbatim next time. But I don't know that I would want to risk another fine batch of oysters.</p>"

I scaled down the recipe fo a smaller, first time test batch. Used half and half instead of milk for a velvety richness (like it needed it with all that cheese). Stirring constantly at the point of adding the milk is key, until the cheese mixture is smooth but not a runny liquid consistency. Once texture is achieved, take off the heat and stop stirring. Using a nonstick sauce pan was perfect. If you want to make them ahead of serving, broil until lightly browned. Pull out of oven and cover with foil. When ready to serve, reheat (uncovered) under broiler for 3 or 4 minutes. Lemon is a good finishing touch! Delicious! Enjoy!</p>"

The compound butter does not require cheeses, bacon, spinach, milk, beer, garlic or onion!

We hosted an ""Oyster Shucking Shindig"", placed open oysters over rock salt on baking sheets, cover them with this sauce recipe, I added real bacon pieces on top before sprinkling with bread crumbs.  Bake until tops start to slightly brown, about 12 minutes and serve them up.  Delish!  All my guests said they were the best oysters they had ever tasted and no restaurant even compared.  I live along the Gulf Coast so fresh oysters are plentiful and all good restaurants have a version but these were spectacular!  Thanks for the recipe.</p>"

I bought extra oysters to compensate for what i thought was going to be bad first try but they ended up perfect. I left out the mozzarella and added real bacon pieces. Keep in mind that all the cheese makes it salty enough, so taste before you add any. This recipe is very easy to follow, but the whole process if pretty time consuming. The pay off is great though and this will surely be a dish to impress. Thanks for the recipe!</p>"

Pour the sauce over the fish and top with a little Parmesean or Italian cheese on the top and pop it into the oven to brown. FANTASTIC!  My family always requests this.

I have to say, I was very hesitant but THRILLED when I finally tasted them.  I cut the quantity way down and made 10 large oysters.  I cut the filling in half and just barely filled my oysters so perhaps this recipe is meant for smaller oysters.  Nonetheless, I followed the recipe to the letter (except I increased the garlic significantly and added a shake of red pepper flakes) and omitted the mozzarella as others recommended and served it with fresh squeezed lemon and Tabasco on top (the way we eat our baked clams) and it was crazy good!

I used freshly caught cod (@2 lbs. of thick filets) that I seasoned with S&amp;P and placed, snuggly fitting, in a veggie-sprayed casserole. I made your cheesy-spinach topping, using less salt and only 8-oz of mixed cheeses (gouda &amp; mozzarella). I spread that mixture top of those cod filets in smooth layer. I subbed @3/4 cup of Durkee French Fried Onions for the bread crumb topping. Baked for @30 minutes in a preheated 350° oven until the dish was bubbling and the onion topping was brown and crispy. Fabulous taste, moist fish! It reheats great and tastes just as good leftover (with gentle microwave reheating)! Thanks for jump-starting a new way to enjoy the abundance of fish that I'm grateful to enjoy. Can't wait to try it on some oysters!</p>"

On a shortcut note, I was running out of time - so I cut out the whole pan mizing part.

I think I've used this recipe before, but didn't make the slight mistake I did this time.  It's regarding the general instructions at the beginning before the list of ingredients.  It says to combine the dry ingredients, and combine the wet ingredients.  That's ALMOST correct.  I took it too literally and wound up putting the 3 cups of sugar in the same bowl as the 3 1/2 cups of flour.  Luckily, I hadn't stirred them together yet and was able to get MOST of the sugar out and into the bowl with the eggs, oil, water and pumpkin.  The loaves appear ok.  Now I usually don't do that when I make pumpkin bread.  I'll have to remember to jump to the recipe and not read the intro with that ""a little bit too general advice"".  I am going to see if I can get away with using maybe two cups of sugar the next time I make this.  Three cups sounds like a lot, even divided between two loaves.&amp;[Worth the effort,A keeper!,Great flavors,Family favorite]</p>"

Bake time for an electric oven is 50 minutes and closer to 60 minutes for a gas oven.  When baking in electric, it doesn't hurt to test for readiness at about 45 minutes.  Bear in mind, that the loaf will cook for a few minutes after it is removed from the oven.  Let it cool enough for handling then wrap in plastic or foil while still warm.  Makes for a moister loaf.

Strangely enough, I had already followed some reviewers suggestions before I read them. Two 4 oz tails were boiled and stripped of the meat...yielding 3 5/8 oz meat. Therefore I did a recipe for one. Didn't have green onions so used a little caramelized sweet onion. I had a strong garlic Aoili which I diluted with some Lite Mayo, added some Dijon and Tabasco. It was tasty in a WW hot dog bun I toasted with a little butter. Boy howdy...
wouldn't want to get too used to this. Being cold, it's real easy and like one reviewer suggested...letting the mayo mix marry overnight doesn't hurt. It's not fresh Lobster in butter, but it stretches things nicely. BTW, lettuce is nice, but optional. A little Spinach added a nice green, though not the crunch of crisp lettuce.</p>"

And I can vouch that the tails were cooked perfectly because I had a taste right when they came out of the oven. This recipe may be a perfect match for the original but for my money it was far from the best use of the lobster. I'd call it fairly good but certainly not great. Still it was something I've always wanted to try and I appreciate your posting a fairly authentic recipe. But in the future I'd still go for just plain with a little lemon &amp; butter.</p>

After looking at all the different recipes out there and sampling lobster rolls in many different restaurants, I found what I think, is by far the simplest abd best tasting lobster roll. Use lobster meat at room temperature and cut/rip into bite sized peices...I actually took the meat out of an 8 lb monster, but whatever size you like. Melt a fair amount of butter...I used a stick and a half...and allow it to cool. Add the juice of 1 lemon and mix. Now pour it over the meat and coat thoroughly. Now butter and toast potato rolls. Add the lobster and you are done! You're not taking away from the taste of the lobster meat at all and putting only what you would normally add to a whole lobster! It was really delicious, I highly recommend it!</p>"

For those that said the cake was dry - I doubt you followed the recipe, there was nothing dry about the cake. You had to cream the butter and sugar until fluffy and I think that's where many people go wrong.</p>"

First, the cake layers were only about a half an inch high.  The cake was so dry that when I went to cut it for the first time, it was actually tough.  

I followed the directions exactly for the custard and the custard has the consistency of eggnog, way to runny.  After three attempts at the custard, I tossed all the bathches down the sink and I ran out to the grocery store and repalced it with vanilla instant pudding.  It tasted better than the ""custard milk"" in flavor and had the right consistency.  

As for the icing, it did have wonderful flavor and if there is anything good about this recipe, it is the icing.  It was lumpy in apprearance from the convection sugar being added at the end, but tasted great and poured nicely over the cake and sides.  

I will make a Boston Cream Pie again, but I will not be using this recipe.  With all my Publix runs, these two cakes ended up taking me 4 hours to make and I was late to their birthday party.</p>"

It came out great, although it is a bit time consuming.  Do not use a store bought cake mix if you want an authentic Boston Cream Pie.  It calls for a sponge or butter cake, which is denser than the fluffy layer cake, and there is less volume.  Be careful when you make substitutions - those who commented that there wasn't enough filling or frosting probably had too much cake.</p>"

I thought that I might make again in the future and make a homemade sponge cake keeping everything else the same. But, by the next day the cake tasted better. It may have been more dense to hold the cream. I wasn't sure what light cream was, so I used heavy cream I had in the fridge and it worked fine. Some people mentioned that they thought the pudding was lumpy, but mine turned out alright. I noticed it was actually a pastry cream which is thicker and less smooth anyway. If it wasn't I would have just ran it through a sieve. I measured out 3 oz of semi-sweet choc. chips on my kitchen scale and it came out to be 1/3 of a cup packed very tightly. The cake only fills about 1"" of both pans before baked, but is a good thickness. I cooked everything on low (3) and had no problems. I made a design on top after a Boston Cream Pie recipe on another site. I enjoyed trying the recipe. Cake taste better the next day, be patient. Thanks.</p>"

The filling went wrong somewhere around the ""whisk in the 2 eggs"" part, that apparently wasn't enough to completely mix all the ingredients although it looked uniform; if I was to do it over again I'd beat the eggs with the salt until completely homogenized before adding to the other ingredients. I had to bail out to boxed pudding. The ganache (icing) went wrong at the add 1/4 cup conf. sugar and beat vigorously part; this resulted in a somewhat lumpy and grainy texture that no amount of beating would fix. If I was to do it over I'd maybe sift it in a little at a time or I'm told that corn syrup is good for this kind of icing. The flavor was great though, dark and rich but sweet enough. All in all people enjoyed it and I'll probably try it again, watch out for those tricky spots though.</p>"

Like others, I cheated and used a cake mix and jello pudding as filling. But the frosting came out beautifully! It was fortunate that I actually had the semisweet baking squares. I wonder how it would turn out if you had to sub chocolate chips? I didn't have any cream so I used whole milk instead and it worked just fine. So easy and so fancy looking with the smooth frosting. Will definitely use again!</p>"

I cheated and made a yellow cake mix in a sheet cake pan, turned it out, and (once it cooled) cut it in half with a piece of string down the center.  I then put the bottom half back in (carefully!) and made this cream recipe, I had to quadruple it to get enough, but it was very good.  I then put the top half of the cake on, and made a triple  batch of this glaze and poured it on top.  I had to add a little extra powdered sugar though to cut the tart semisweet taste.  After the glaze hardened in the fridge I took some of the custard/filling I had saved, put it in a baggie, kneaded it with my hands, snipped off a corner and then drizzled it over the top of the cake to make it prettier.  The end result, it was delicious and beautiful!  Tasted just like from a restaurant only it served way more people.  A coworker loved the custard filling so much, she ate four pieces (ha ha!)  Thank you for the recipe!</p>"

I must admit that I made the process easier by bypassing the ""cake from scratch"" part and substituted a Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix instead ... much easier and I'm sure just as yummy.  I did have trouble trying to figure out what ""light cream"" was.  Didn't have anything like that in my grocery store ... I ended up buying something called ""table cream"" which turns out to be light cream with some sodium.  I ommited the pinch of salt for the filling since cream already had.  Otherwise, the icing was superb and it was easy to put together!</p>"

My loaf came out a bit wet and dense in the middle. The flavor is excellent though and the crust has that signature cornmeal crunch! I'm going to test out a few other versions of this recipe to find something closer to the crumb and texture I'm used to from my old breadmaker version of this loaf.</p>

Make Dinner Rolls, but be sure to make enough because, you could start an argument if people have to fight over them. I am a fan of Rustic Recipes that go well with BBQ, Beans, Trail-type outdoors cooking, that is very forgiving. This bread is best when the top gets a little too much heat(charring), perfect for camping or cooking in a wood stove or on a pizzastone, and actually gives it the look it would have had back then.</p>"

This means, I mixed the dough with a little extra water (about a cup total), used a teaspoon of instant yeast (which I don't bother to mix with water first--just add yeast to dry ingredients and water with wet ingredients) rather than the active dry yeast, then let it rise for 8 hours.  I turned it out on a generously floured board, floured the top, let it rest for 10 min. or so.   Then folded it over on itself several times and gathered it into a ball.  I put it on parchment paper and let it rise another couple of hours covered by a cloth napkin.  I then scored the top of the loaf with a razor and baked it in a dutch oven that had been heated in the oven--I lowered the loaf into the pot holding onto the edges of the parchment.  I baked at 450 rather than 375, about 25 minutes with the lid on, 10 with the lid off.  Also, I used a full 3 cups of flour--right from the beginning (a mixture of 2/3 bread flour, 1/3 whole wheat flour), then a little extra as indicated.  

The bread does not have the crusty crust of most artisan breads, and it actually wasn't my favorite bread (I'm partial to the plain old flour and water variety).  But it was well received by some at dinner and the recipe and technique were highly successful.  It was not nearly as dense as I expected.  It rose very nicely and created a beautiful loaf. I would not even attempt this bread if you don't have very good molasses available to you.  </p>"
21194989,6663675,SCOUTSAGIRL,5,1,0,1214992866753,https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1150500,"<p>This was a good, good bread recipe, and very satisfying. The texture is moist and chewy with a relatively fine crumb. It is not too sweet. The top of the loaf darkens nicely but the crust is not too hard. Other reviewers have mentioned the proportions in the recipe being off, but I did not personally find that to be the case. Different flours offer different absorbency, and of course anything with flour is affected by humidity. If you just trust your instincts rather than blaming the recipe, you'll have good results. I did add about 1/2 c. extra flour while kneading as it did feel a bit too sticky. However, it came together nicely after only about 5 minutes of hand kneading rather than the 8 suggested in teh recipe. Also, the cook time in my oven was slightly shorter than the 30 minutes listed. My suggestion is to set the timer for 25 minutes, then give it a tap and put it in for the remaining five if it seems underdone. This bread recipe is now one that will go in my rotation of breads, and will become a gift-giving bread as well. </p>"

I tried three times (with brand new yeast -active and then the quick rise) and the bread just never took off.  Next time I might double the yeast.  Even though it was a little doughy in the middle it still made great french toast and grilled cheese sandwiches!</p>

Use warm water (120-130 degrees F)since we used quick rise yeast (aka rapid rise). Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. We are in Anadama heaven! I also did not soak the cornmeal since I used finely ground cornmeal--but even so the crunch is pleasant. I also did not knead this dough--dough will be sticky, just place in 2qt well greased round casserole dish and cover with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and let rise for about 1hr.

I read the comments about how the cooking time was too long so after cooking for 4 hours, I removed the meat, covered with tin foil and set aside.  I then added the vegetables and boiled for the 30 minutes specified. The meat came out perfectly cooked and melted in our mouths. I like my veggies a little firmer so next time I will only boil for 20 minutes. I like to eat corn beef with mustard, hubby likes horseradish. Hubby also adds butter to the cabbage and potatoes.

I do add the seasoning packet with the brisket from the start.  The only thing I add different from this recipe is I add one tsp. of minced garlic from a jar.  If you strain your spices out of the juice in your stew pot after you take all your veggies and meat out the juice makes a wonderfully flavored dip as well as good spooned onto your potatoes.  I always boil my regular pot roasts the same way after first searing them in a little bit of oil to seal in the juices and I season it as I'm searing it with salt, pepper, powdered garlic, not garlic salt.  Cover with water and boil until the meat is tender then add your carrots and potatoes, cook until tender.  I use more whole onions in mine and leave them whole.  Then once I take my meat and veggies out I made a gravy with the juices left in the pot.</p>"

There isnt much of a variety at the grocery stores. Often, the blood is all leaked out of the meat.
Sold at discount grocery chains.
Perhaps if I went to a butcher shop the quality would be better.

In my area it is impossible to find a 5lb corned beef so I got one 2lb and one 3lb one.  The 2lb one was done after about 2 hours cooking time (on top of the initial boiling) and the 3lb was done after 2.5  hours cooking time (on top of initial boiling).  This is an hour difference from the way it was written.  I advise checking after an hour and a half and ever half hour subsequently.  The meat should be slice-able but soft-- def not shredded.  Also pro top- Corned beef SHRINKS.  A lot.  When figuring out how much to buy, assume it will shrink by 50%.  Yes it's a huge scam-- but a tasty one.</p>"

Added 1/2 a bottle of Guinness Stout to the cooking liquid.(from another reviewer)
Washed the meat (significantly reduces amt. of foam scum to skim)
Added spice packet + caraway seeds (1/2 tsp) and thyme (1 tsp, at last 1/2 hour cooking).
Suggest taste broth before adding veggies.  It may need salt.  
I removed the meat from the stock and coated with bread crumbs (another recipe) but found it didn't add anything to the dish. Won't do again.
Suggestion from mother to add butter &amp; salt &amp; pepper to veggies after they are cooked.</p>"

I did use the bottle of beer, and added the spice packet, and DID NOT rinse the meat.  The package says not to, otherwise you wash away all the seasonings.

My favorite version uses deveined jumbo shrimp, big scallops, small lobster tails, mussels and/or clams and large cubes of cod that have been tossed with olive oil, a little lemon pepper and a dollop of Dijon mustard.  I layer the bottom of the pot with corn husks (for protection) then new potatoes, corn chunks, a quartered onion, and a halved, whole bulb of garlic.  I add the chicken broth and about a cup of Pinot blanc and bring to a simmer.  Once that's going, I layer on the seafood and a link of sausage cut into 2"" pieces.  Sprinkle liberally with Old Bay Seasoning, some salt and chunks of butter.  Since I have a bay tree, I tuck in some sprigs of bay leaf with a quartered lemon.  I top all that with a banana leaf that's been cut to fit the pot.  Then I seal the pot with aluminum foil and a lid and simmer until the potatoes are tender (about 30 min). I love this.  Love it.

I believed that the potatoes would be more than done, but the seafood would be overcook by the prescribed time of 45 minutes. I parboiled the potatoes in salt water for 10 minutes as another reviewer had written, then immersed them in tap water. To the low-sodium chicken broth with 1 cup white wine, add 3 small-medium onions, 6 large whole peeled garlic cloves, and a handful of rough chop spring onions (did not have leeks). Season to taste with salt and pepper when it starts to boil. You'll have an idea of what the broth will taste by then. Added the potatoes after seasoning. Then layers of clams, mussels, and shrimp. Left on boil for 10 minutes, then lowered to a simmer for another 10. With 20 minutes cooking time, I still thought the clams and mussels were overdone. The colossal shrimp was just right. Corn was boiled in another pot, on its own. I served the broth as a side too. We'll remember this for another July 4th celebration.</p>"

I took a large stockpot, put the red potatoes on bottom, a layer of clams, layer of mussels, and then snow crab legs instead of the shrimp.  We also put a banana leaf on top for steaming (can also use seaweed).  We added the entire 48 oz of chicken stock and a bottle of beer instead of vermouth.  After sealing tightly, we followed the recipe's instructions for 45 minutes on Med-low (after bringing to a boil).  We also included Old Bay Seasoning  I was afraid the seafood would be overdone, but it wasn't.  Excellent- especially the snow crab!  A nice surprise was how delicious and soft the red potatoes came out.  The skin had a lovely taste and the insides were creamy.  We're already planning our next one, with a bigger pot and more seafood :).</p>"

We gathered together from all over the country to celebrate out mother's 60th birthday.  We filled up a huge pot with potatoes, corn, sausage, shrimp, clams, mussels and lobster tails.  We did layer seaweed in bottom of pot and in between some layers to avoid scorching.  We used a mix of chicken broth and white wine as well as chopped garlic, sea salt and old bay seasoning.  We steamed it over our firepit for about 45-60 minutes.  We put brown paper on a large table outside and poured the contents of the pot on the table.  Everyone just gathered around the table and feasted on the food as they liked.  It was so delicious and fun we decided it was going to be our 1st annual clam bake to be repeated every summer.  We may change the order of placement of seafood because the shrimp and mussels did get a little over done.  Also be careful how much liquid you use.  You don't really want the seafood floating in it.  We may change a few things next time but I would recommend trying this for a fun and different meal.  Thanks for the post.</p>"

For our personal preference, next time I will probably leave out the potatoes - with the corn and yummy seafood, no one in my family even touched the potatoes.  Also, I will double the clams and mussels.  I used seafood stock (all I had) and added a quarter of a lemon and a few cloves of garlic to the broth while cooking.  I also cooked this a bit differently since I didn't want the seafood coming out tough or rubbery. I started with par-boiling my potatoes in salted water. Then I dumped out the water and added the corn to the potatoes and the broth and my additions of lemon and garlic. I cooked these for about 5 minutes. I added the clams in a single layer on top of the corn and potatoes and steamed for eight minutes. Pulled them out. Added the mussels in a single layer for 8 mintues. Pulled them out and added the shrimp for a few minutes until cooked through (maybe 5 minutes?). Then I put the clams and mussels back into the pot and served with crusty french bread and melted butter.  The broth was fabulous and the seafood was just right (not tough and rubbery or shriveled). I will definitely make it again.  </p>"

The first time I made it the broth had no flavor, so I changed it a little bit this time(I hate when people do this, but...)by using a bottle of beer with the chicken broth, a bag of mccormick's shrimp boil seasoning, a head of garlic, a few onions, and adding kielbasy and corn to the mix.  The broth was PERFECT for dipping with bread. This is the perfect summer one pot meal!</p>"

The first problem is the order in which they say to put everything in a Dutch Oven.  If you put a large head of cabbage (thinly sliced) in a Dutch Oven it is overflowing before adding beef, tomatoes, onions, etc.  Second, the recipe says only to cook on low.  It never says to raise the temperature.  If you put cabbage on the bottom of a Dutch oven with the tomatoes, onions, and beef on top, it will never cook (correctly) in 45 minutes.  Overall the ratio of cabbage to beef was way off.  It needed at least 2-3X more beef.  As for taste it was ok.  Not good.  Not bad.  But the recipe clearly needs to be rewritten.

The only real change that I make is to only use one cup of water.  When making the sauce, I mix all the ingredients in a bowl first.  After sauteing the onions and garlic for about three minutes in a medium high heat skillet, I add the ground beef and fry it off, and drain the fat.  After adding the sauce it's only a matter waiting for the sauce to reduce.  I cook mine in a cast iron skillet and don't have any brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. So no need for the extra cup of water that would only serve to dilute the sauce.  Change the recipe to only one cup of water and I'll give it five duds stars.</p>"

My favorite way to use this though, is for making Horseshoe/Ponyshoes which is the hamburger patty on toasted bread topped with french fries, sometimes carmelized onions depending on my mood, and then topped with this cheese sauce. You do want to use a good quality sharp or even extra sharp cheese with a lot of flavor because that makes this.

It tastes just like I remembered and was so simple and easy to clean up! I only used milk since I can't drink beer (still a minor, haha.) and I never brought the mixture to a boil as it combined perfectly fine on low.

My only criticism for this recipe's instructions is that it said that the initial flour mixture should be mixed until ""smooth and bubbly"", giving me the impression that it was going to be liquid. However, this was not the case, so I slowly added the milk during that step to combine with the dough-like flour/butter/sauce mix. After I added the milk and cheese, it did become smooth and bubbly and turned out perfect.</p>"

My mom has made this all the time and mine didn't come out as quite as hers does but it was yummy for the first time. It took me two times to make it because I used beer but it was a darker beer and it tasted way to beery. So I started over omitting the beer completely and replaced a dash of soy sauce instead of worcheister (sp) sauce. I think next time I will make sure to have the worscheister sauce and do it the same way without the beer since I have a daughter that I wanted to enjoy it as well.

Momfish has an excellent recipe.  I made it pretty much exactly as written, but used a 16 ounce block of cheddar, chopped into pieces, and an extra 1/4 cup of beer (Yuengling porter- its what was in the fridge).  Although this recipe is considered a meal, I placed it in a fondue pot and used it as an appetizer.  Most fondue separates into oil and milk solids which you need to keep stirring, but Welsh Rarebit does not separate in a fondue pot, even after several hours.

This can easily be made with either all milk or all beer, but the 2 together are especially tasty. Best when eaten immediately as the leftover sauce quickly became cold &amp; more solidified. I lightly toasted ciabatta bread slices (1/2 inch thick), then put the solid sauce on top to reheat in the microwave for about 45 seconds. It was good. Next time I'll probably sprinkle in some chipotle or red chile powder, because I like that spicy flavor, rather than increase the vinegary hot pepper sauce.</p>"

I tried it this way the 1st time I made it but didn't like the idea of layering the raw meat &amp; raw potatoes. So I made a huge yet easier modification. I cook my ground beef in a skillet on the stove. While that is cooking I cook my sliced potatoes with onions &amp; bell peppers to an electric skillet. When everything is cooked I add the meat to the potatoes in the electric skillet &amp; then tomato soup &amp; pork n beans. Let everything cook together until hot. It is so much easier &amp; so many good flavors.</p>

Put it in raw and the juices and fat that will render from the meat will be enough juice to make this casserole yummy.  I chop up the onions so you get a bit of onion w every bite.

I  baked it for an hour at 375 and then put cheese on top and and baked till melted. Turned out great and enjoyed it. I also used red potatoes and left the skins on. I was a little unsure about the beans but put them on and it was great.

I pre-browned the ground beef as per recommendation and added a soy seasoning packet.  I also used an 18.7 ounce can of Campbell's Homestyle Harvest Tomato and Basil instead of the condensed soup.  Cooked a half hour covered then only 20 minutes uncovered with a ton of sharp cheddar cheese on top.

Next time I'll definitely cook it longer, the potatoes are cooked but not as soft as I'd personally like.  Also, to keep it from being dry, when you serve it spoon a little of the tomato soup from the bottom of the casserole over your dish so it stays juicy.  I think next time I'll add corn, and chop the onions up more.</p>"

23266306,6562559,Allrecipes Member,3,2,0,1130255987560,,"<p>I just had to make this recipe after reading all the reviews! To prevent the dish from being dry, follow my suggestions. Using a 10"" round 2.5 qt casserole I layered thinly sliced potatoes, some salt, RAW ground sirloin, some salt, pepper and garlic powder, thinly sliced onion, the well drained and rinsed kidney beans and then topped it with the tomato soup. I covered the casserole with aluminum foil and baked it at 375 for one hour. I then took off the foil for 30 minutes and continued to bake it. Maybe because round is leaner than beef, it really is not necessary to uncover this dish. The liquid starts to evaporate and the beans will dry out. If you brown the beef first, it removes the cooking liquid (and fat and flavor)and the dish will be dry.
This dish was pretty good. The meat reminded me of meatloaf with a side of potatoes and beans in sauce. Hands on time was about 5 minutes(use a mandoline for the potatoes and onions and it's even faster. My whole family liked it and ate it. My 5 yr old said ""this is nice and warm for a cold day"" and my 15 yr old said it was different but good. Not the healthiest dish but it sure was easy! I would make it again.</p>"

I also added some garlic salt to cooked beef (potato layer definately needs to be salted on its own) and shredded cheddar on top after it was done--just put back in oven long enough to melt cheese.</p>"

Sometimes I pre-toast one side in my toaster that has a setting designed for bagels that only toasts one side, sometimes I pre-fry one buttered side of the bread - and that’s the side I put the cheese on. Then I butter and fry the put together pieces on both sides.

Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side-up on top of sandwich. Grill until lightly browned and flip over; continue grilling until cheese is melted.

My family generally makes grilled cheese sandwiches on a griddle, so you could theoretically make about four to eight at a time. We just put the butter straight on the griddle then put as many slices of bread on that can fit. As soon as the first slice is finished toasting, we butter and flip it to the other side, putting a slice of cheese on the toasted side and a slice of half toasted bread on top with the toasted side on the cheese. This ensures the cheese will melt, as it will be between two warm toasted sides. Once the bottom side of the sandwich finishes toasting butter and flip it to toast the top. Make sure to use plenty of butter throughout the process.

Next time I'm going to steal someone's idea of putting some garlic/oregano/basil in the butter to see how that turns out. Yum!</p>"

I use the brown and cover on low method to make mine. I think the results of this post just goes to show that the grilled cheese is one of the most versatile, delicious sandwiches on the planet. It’s not vegan, but it can be!  And it is vegetarian, yet ardently desired by meat-eaters. It can be made countless ways, without deviating from its grilled cheeseness. There is no “best” way.  In the case of a grilled cheese, it’s really “all good”!  I’d say it leaves burgers in the dust!</p>"

May I add that I've found a pan on a stove works better for grilled cheese than an electric skillet or griddle. The heat is more even. Oh, and don't squish the sandwiches with your spatula. It ruins the fluffy texture of the bread, which is perfect against the golden buttery crispness of the grilled outer layer.</p>"

It’s scary knowing they’re off forging their own path, but the memories kept in a grilled cheese are keeping me from bawling my eyes out knowing i’ll be waking up without my boys in the home. Even though it hurts, this is a pain that hopefully every parent can experience, to see their children grow and flourish. I even made one with mayonnaise instead of butter.

I didn't cream of chicken soup, so I used cream of mushroom and added a little chicken bouillon for a deeper flavor.  I didn't have canned peas and canned carrots.  I had fresh carrots so I sliced them up and sauteed them in a little butter.  I also had some diced red bell pepper.  I sauteed the diced onion and a little bell pepper.  I threw in frozen peas.  I put them in frozen, they thaw really quick in the hot liquid.  I also used almond milk instead of cow milk.  I didn't have croutons, so I did seasoned bread crumbs on top.  It was really good and it is a great base recipe to work from.  You can easily add different stuff in to this to change it up some.</p>"

I followed someone elses suggestion &amp; boiled chicken breast is some seasoning-I used mrs dash garlic.  Then added peas &amp; mushrooms.  My husband loved it, so I made a second the next day for my grandma- a hit again.</p>"

25386180,6650548,Allrecipes Member,5,31,0,1158430728013,,"<p>This recipe was so yummy and definetly a great Comfort food. I made it for my boyfriend and he gave me major kudos and high fives. We liked it better than the tuna noodle casserole I make. I did change a few things which I think made it even better. I boiled the chicken in water until it could be shredded. Then I sauted the chicken in butter just to brown it a little with red onion, chopped celery, salt, pepper and garlic powder. I also steamed fresh broccoli and chopped carrots to add as vegetables and I added corn and peas to the mixture. I didn't have chili powder or paprika so I used cayenne pepper to taste depending on how spicy you want it but it gave it a little kick but not too much. I also used white cheddar and mild cheddar block cheese and montery jack with jalapenos block cheese that I cut into little medium sized strips and stired some into the whole mixture  to make it extra creamy and cheesy which tasted awesome. I used the rest of my cheese strips to put on top. I did not have any bread only club crackers, so I crushed them up and sprinkled over the cheese if I had ritz crackers I would have used those but the other was still great on top adding some crunch which I think sounds better than bread. It was all just so delicious and I will be making this over and over again!</p>"

You can use pretty much any veggie and meat you like for this cassarole, but in my case, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken to make sure the noodles and the chicken stayed creamy and moist. I used canned corn instead of peas and carrots...the corn gave it more texture. And finally, I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed up Ritz crackers for the topping instead...it gave it more of a crunchy and buttery taste. Overall, the recipe was very good, simple and cheap to make :)</p>"

I did add maybe 3 T. of minced onion and 1 clove of minced garlic.  I wouldn't recommend putting the noodles in the bottom of the pan, set aside and then add and toss with Chicken mixture.  I used half of a 398g package of medium egg noodles.</p>"

I used 1 teaspoon of dried onion flakes, a small can of corn in place of the peas &amp; carrots (yuck!), added a dash of Frank's Red Hot Sauce for 'zing', Cheddar cheese instead of Jack, and topped all of it off with a small can of French Fried Onions for crunch!  Scaled it down to serve 4...made enough for at least 6 ample servings. I think this is a good base for any left over poultry, meat or fish. By the way, using  1/2 can soup and 1/2 can sour cream will reduce the sodium in this recipe.

I will probably use shredded chedder next time.  I also didn't use onions. I used onion salt and Mrs. Dash to cook the chicken instead.  Used sourdough bread for the topping and that was very good. Will definitely make again.</p>"

I also sprayed the top of the bread cubes with a little spray margarine before baking.  It turned out quite well, and was even better left over the next day. Thanks!</p>"

I generally use different vegetables depending on how quickly we need to eat.  The first time I used fresh broccoli and carrots.  Steamed them first then added to the pan with the soup mixture.  Today I used a can of peas and carrots and a can of corn.  Turned out great both times!</p>

I added some sliced fresh mushrooms &amp; mixed some cheddar with the jack cheese.  Even with the addition of the chili powder called for in the recipe, we thought this was pretty bland.  The bread cubes on top were a bit strange.  I'd used whole wheat bread cubes.  If you like this type of recipe, I'd think that crushed Ritz cracker crumbs or potato chips would make a tastier topping.</p>"
